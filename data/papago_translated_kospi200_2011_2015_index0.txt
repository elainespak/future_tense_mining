The domestic cotton textile industry has a long history as an industry that has led the development of the nation's industries since liberation, and many companies using cheap labor have newly entered the cotton mill industry through the 70s and 80s, expanding the size of their facilities and achieving the highest peak. However, in the '90s, the increasing manpower shortage and cheap products imported from underdeveloped countries have weakened competitiveness, and many companies have recently sought new developments, focusing on a few companies that succeeded in corporate restructuring and product specialization. Sales in the cotton industry, in the form of supplying basic raw materials for the textile industry, are generally in a difficult situation due to the decrease in consumption due to the sluggish domestic economy and the delay in the recovery of export orders in advanced countries, resulting in a decline in inventory growth and worsening profitability. Also, raw cotton, the main ingredient of cotton, depends on imports at 100%, so prices move sensitively according to exchange rate or economic fluctuations and crop conditions, and take up a large portion of manufacturing costs, so there are limitations in cost reduction, which makes it difficult to secure profitability. Under such circumstances, the Korean cotton textile industry strives to secure profitability and differentiate itself by developing high value-added new products and producing specialized products to avoid overlapping production with developing countries and to gain market advantage in terms of productivity and quality by continuously promoting supplementation and automation of aging facilities.. The Korean economy maintained a healthy economic recovery rate of more than 5% in the first half of 2011 until the first quarter of 2011, but it is expected to grow 3.7% in the first half as economic growth slowed down in the second quarter along with rising uncertainties over the global economic recovery. Also, due to the fiscal crisis in Europe that resurfaced in the second quarter of 2011, the massive earthquake in Japan, and the difficulty of the U.S. debt ceiling talks that triggered the dollar weakness, the average export growth rate of 30% supported the Korean economy until the first quarter of 2011, but the export growth rate is expected to fall significantly after the first quarter of 2011, and the consumption slump is not expected to improve significantly in the second half of 2011. However, the Chinese government's tightening stance has been gradually weakened, forecasting a U-shaped economic recovery in the second half, as the default concerns have been reduced due to the reduction of financial crisis risks and the price of grain that triggered inflation due to the settlement of the U.S. debt negotiations and approval of the Greek aid plan. Korea's textile industry, which had enjoyed a boom until the first quarter of 2011, is experiencing a difficult time as its performance has slowed significantly in the second quarter with the sharp fall in raw material prices. The temporary recovery in global consumption led to 22.3 percent growth in textile exports in the first half of the year, but some lifting of India's export restriction policy has led to a sharp decline in the original price and repeated vicious cycle of buyers delaying the purchase of the original materials, but the company expects a moderate recovery in the fourth quarter due to the expectation of the domestic textile industry's investment in automated facilities, the Korea-U.S. FTA and the EU FTA.. We achieved good performance in the first half of the year due to synergistic effects of our production facility rationalization work. The Gwangju plant achieved the highest productivity based on the latest facilities, and this year will also increase facility investment to double its production capacity. The Yongin plant will also increase productivity by increasing facilities and concentrate on producing high-value added products in accordance with facility characteristics to contribute to the maximization of profit, while the semi-wol plant also strives to have the best competitive edge. However, we will overcome difficult conditions through more aggressive sales strategies and enterprise-wide cost-cutting efforts to improve competitiveness, although we are concerned about increasing inventory and decreasing sales due to difficulties in the external environment. In the first half of the year, the retail distribution market in Korea suffered a decline in consumer confidence due to inflation and interest rate hikes, which led to the spread of thrift and consumption.. As a result, Times Square has achieved an increase in sales of more than 10% of the year-on-year and a significant increase in operating profit by imprinting the brand of Korea's No.1 shopping mall to customers and meeting customer satisfaction through diverse and active marketing activities focusing on customers. In the second half of 2011, we will strive to increase sales steadily through various marketing campaigns to impress customers. Although the business environment in 2011 is expected to face many difficulties such as soaring international raw material prices and foreign exchange rate issues, we will open a new era in the city by gathering the wisdom of all the members of the staff and employees of the county to overcome the crisis and make a bigger leap forward. 2) As a material producer and real estate leasing company that produces and manufactures yarn and processing companies such as textile, maryas, socks, and footwear materials, the company consists of 28% domestic consumption, 72% export (LOCAL: 64%, DIRECT: 8%).

The characteristics of the procurement of major raw materials 1) We import 100% from the U.S., Australia, Brazil, and others for practical purposes. The ICE futures market, which is the basis for international prices, once saw a surge of more than $2 per pound due to severe imbalance in supply and demand due to increased production and plummeting original prices, and is now trading at a level of $1 per pound. Therefore, if the original price does not recover due to the nature of the raw import process reflected in the market and time difference of raw materials, it is expected to be the second half of the year when manufacturing costs are significantly burdened by high raw material rain. 2) Price variation of key raw materials such as the actual purchase amount of raw materials for purchased cotton in the business sector (units: $1,000), non-replaceable USD 34,895 (85%), US, Australia, Brazil, etc. 3), and key raw materials (units: Â¢/Lb) 126th half of the year raw cotton calculated on a yearly basis of 125: Yearly face value of 125.
