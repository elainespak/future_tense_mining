       "\"Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation. The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the Company or AMD) have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP) for interim financial information and the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 10 of Regulation S-X. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 28, 2019 shown in this report are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full year ending December 28, 2019 . In the opinion of the Companys management, the information contained herein reflects all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the Companys results of operations, financial position, cash flows and s tockholders' equity . All such adjustments are of a normal, recurring nature. The unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation. The Company uses a 52 or 53 week fiscal year ending on the last Saturday in December. The three and nine months ended September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018 each consisted of 13 weeks and 39 weeks, respectively. Principles of Consolidation. The condensed consolidated financial statements include the Companys accounts and those of its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All inter-company accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Significant Accounting Policies. Except for the accounting policies highlighted below, there have been no material changes to the Company's significant accounting policies in Note 2 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018. Leases. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, at the inception of the arrangement. When the Company determines the arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, at lease inception, it then determines whether the lease is an operating lease or a finance lease. Operating and finance leases result in the Company recording a right-of-use (ROU) asset and lease liability on its balance sheet. ROU assets represent the Company's right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent its obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating and finance lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. In determining the present value of lease payments, the Company uses the implicit interest rate if readily determinable or when the implicit interest rate is not readily determinable, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes any lease incentives. Specific lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when the Company believes it is reasonably certain that it will exercise that option. Lease expense for operating lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. As allowed by the guidance, the Company has elected not to recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities that arise from short-term (12 months or less) leases for any class of underlying asset. Operating leases are included in operating lease ROU assets, other current liabilities, and long-term operating lease liabilities in the Company's condensed consolidated balance sheet. The Company's finance leases are immaterial. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards Leases. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842) , to increase transparency and comparability among organizations for lease recognition and disclosure. ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet, while recognizing expenses on the income statements in a manner similar to legacy guidance. The Company adopted this standard in the first quarter of 2019, using the optional adoption method, which did not require an adjustment to comparative period financial statements, and recorded $228 million of right-of-use assets and $261 million of lease liabilities primarily related to office buildings in its consolidated balance sheet as of December 30, 2018. The Company's accounting for capital leases, now referred to as finance leases, remains unchanged. The Company's adoption of the new standard had no impact on its consolidated statement of operations or on net cash provided by or used in operating, financing, or investing activities on its consolidated statement of cash flows. Upon adoption of ASU 2016-02, the Company elected a transition practical expedient under the new accounting standard allowing it not to separate lease and non-lease components and instead to account for each separate lease component and non-lease component as a single lease component. The Company implemented internal controls and key system functionality to enable the preparation of financial information on adoption. Recently Issued Accounting Standards Financial Instruments. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments . This standard changes the methodology for measuring credit losses on financial instruments and the timing of when such losses are recorded. ASU 2016-13 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, using a modified retrospective adoption method. The Company will adopt this standard in the first quarter of 2020 and this standard will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. There were no other significant updates to the recently issued accounting standards other than as disclosed in the Companys Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018. Although there are several other new accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB, the Company does not believe any of these accounting pronouncements had or will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements..

As of September 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018 , the total assets and liabilities of the THATIC JV were not material. In February 2016, the Company licensed certain of its intellectual property (Licensed IP) to the THATIC JV for a total of $293 million in license fees payable over several years upon achievement of certain milestones. The Company also expects to receive a royalty based on the sales of the THATIC JVs products to be developed on the basis of such Licensed IP.

The Company recognized $60 million as licensing gain associated with the Licensed IP during the nine months ended September 28, 2019 . In March 2017, the Company entered into a development and intellectual property agreement (Development and IP) with the THATIC JV, and also expects to receive a royalty based on the sales of the THATIC JVs products to be developed on the basis of such agreement.

In addition, from time to time, the Company enters into certain agreements with the THATIC JV to provide other services primarily related to research and development. The Companys receivable from the THATIC JV for the above agreements was $13 million and $18 million as of September 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018 , respectively, included in Prepayments and receivables-related parties on its condensed consolidated balance sheets.

The Company is complying with U.S. law pertaining to the Entity List designation.. GLOBALFOUNDRIES In March 2009, the Company and GLOBALFOUNDRIES Inc. (GF) entered into a Wafer Supply Agreement (the WSA) under which the Company would purchase wafers from GF. The WSA, which has been amended from time to time, governs the terms by which the Company purchases products manufactured by GF through March 1, 2024. Pursuant to the WSA and its amendments, the Company is required to purchase all of its microprocessor and APU product requirements, and a certain portion of its GPU product requirements from GF manufactured at process nodes larger than 7 nanometer (nm), with limited exceptions. Under the terms of the WSA, the Company has minimum annual wafer purchase targets through 2021. If the Company fails to meet the agreed wafer purchase target during a calendar year, it will be required to pay to GF a portion of the difference between the actual wafer purchases and the applicable annual purchase target. The Company also agreed to continue to make quarterly payments to GF based on the volume of certain wafers purchased from another wafer foundry. On August 30, 2016, in consideration for the limited waiver and rights under the WSA Sixth Amendment, the Company entered into a warrant agreement (the Warrant Agreement) with West Coast Hitech L.P. (WCH), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mubadala Development Company PJSC (Mubadala). Under the Warrant Agreement, WCH and its permitted assigns were entitled to purchase 75 million shares of the Companys common stock (the Warrant Shares) at a purchase price of $5.98 per share. On February 13, 2019, WCH exercised its warrant to purchase 75 million shares of the Companys common stock at a purchase price of $5.98 per share for a total amount of $449 million . Through May 15, 2019, GF was a related party of the Company because Mubadala and Mubadala Technology Investments LLC (Mubadala Tech, a party to the WSA) were affiliated with WCH, and a member of the Company's Board of Directors (the Board) was associated with Mubadala. GF, WCH and Mubadala Tech are wholly-owned subsidiaries of Mubadala. Effective May 15, 2019, the member of the Board associated with Mubadala retired from the Board, and as a result, GF was no longer considered a related party of the Company. All prior period related party classifications on the financial statements for GF have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation.. Debt, Secured Revolving Facility and Secured Revolving Line of Credit Debt 2.125% Convertible Senior Notes Due 2026 In September 2016, the Company issued $805 million principal amount of 2.125% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 ( 2.125% Notes). The 2.125% Notes mature on September 1, 2026. However, holders of the 2.125% Notes may convert them at their option during certain time periods and upon the occurrence of one of the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after the calendar quarter ending on September 30, 2016 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of the Companys common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day (equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $8.00 per share of common stock); (2) during the five business day period after any ten consecutive trading day period (the Measurement Period) in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of notes for each trading day of the Measurement Period was less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of the Companys common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; or (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. On or after June 1, 2026 until the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their notes at any time, regardless of the foregoing circumstances. Upon conversion, the Company will pay or deliver cash, shares of the Companys common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Companys common stock, at the Companys election. The first event described in (1) above was met during the third quarter of 2019 and as a result, the 2.125% Notes are convertible at the option of the holder from October 1, 2019 until December 31, 2019. During the three and nine months ended September 28, 2019 , the Company converted $126 million principal amount of its 2.125% Notes through the issuance of approximately 16 million shares of the Company's common stock at the conversion price of $8.00 per share and an aggregate cash payment of $14 million . As of September 28, 2019, the Company had $679 million principal of its 2.125% Notes outstanding. The Companys current intent is to deliver shares of its common stock upon conversion of the 2.125% Notes. As such, the Company continued to classify the carrying value of the liability component of the 2.125% Notes as long-term debt and the equity component of the 2.125% Notes as permanent equity on its condensed consolidated balance sheet as of September 28, 2019 . The 2.125% Notes consisted of the following: September 28, 2019 December 29, 2018 (In millions) Principal amounts: Principal $ 679 $ 805 Unamortized debt discount (1) (205 ) (262 ) Unamortized debt issuance costs (8 ) (11 ) Net carrying amount $ 466 $ 532 Carrying amount of the equity component, net (2) $ 258 $ 305 (1) Included in the consolidated balance sheets within Long-term debt, net and amortized over the remaining life of the notes using the effective interest rate method. (2) Included in the consolidated balance sheets within additional paid-in capital, net of $8 million of equity issuance costs. As of September 28, 2019 , the remaining life of the 2.125% Notes was approximately 84 months . Based on the closing price of the Companys common stock of $28.72 on September 27, 2019, the last trading day of the three months ended September 28, 2019 , the if-converted value of the 2.125% Notes exceeded its principal amount by $1,759 million . The effective interest rate of the liability component of the 2.125% Notes is 8% . This interest rate was based on the interest rates of similar liabilities at the time of issuance that did not have associated conversion features. The following table sets forth total interest expense recognized related to the 2.125% Notes: Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 28, 2019 September 29, 2018 September 28, 2019 September 29, 2018 (In millions) Contractual interest expense $ 4 $ 5 $ 12 $ 13 Interest cost related to amortization of debt issuance costs $  $  $ 1 $ 1 Interest cost related to amortization of the debt discount $ 6 $ 6 $ 18 $ 18 6.75% Senior Notes Due 2019 On February 26, 2014, the Company issued $600 million of its 6.75% Senior Notes due March 1, 2019 ( 6.75% Notes).

The Secured Revolving Facility consists of a $500 million , five-year secured revolving loan facility, including a $50 million swingline subfacility and a $75 million sublimit for letters of credit. The Companys obligations under the Credit Agreement are secured by a lien on substantially all of the Companys property, other than intellectual property. The Credit Agreement also provides the ability to increase the Secured Revolving Facility or incur incremental term loans or other incremental equivalent debt by an amount not to exceed certain amounts as set forth in the Credit Agreement. The Company's available borrowings under the Secured Revolving Facility are also subject to reduction by an amount equal to the net cash proceeds of (i) any debt issuances not permitted by the Secured Revolving Facility and (ii) any non-ordinary course asset sales, in excess of $250 million , if such net cash proceeds are not reinvested by the Company within twelve months of receipt. Borrowings under the Secured Revolving Facility bear interest at a variable rate based upon, at the Companys option, either at the LIBOR rate, or the base rate (in each case, as customarily defined) plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin for LIBOR rate loans ranges, based on an applicable total leverage ratio, from 1.00% to 1.75% per annum and the applicable margin for base rate loans ranges from 0.00% to 0.75% per annum. The Company is required to pay fees on the undrawn portion available under the Secured Revolving Facility and in respect of outstanding letters of credit. The Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants, as well as a total leverage covenant requiring the Company to maintain a maximum ratio of consolidated funded debt to consolidated EBITDA of 4.00 :1.00 and an interest coverage covenant requiring the Company to maintain a minimum ratio of consolidated EBITDA to consolidated cash interest expense of 3.00 :1.00. The Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default, which if they occur, could result in the termination of commitments under the Secured Revolving Facility, the declaration that all outstanding loans are immediately due and payable in whole or in part and the requirement to maintain cash collateral deposits in respect of outstanding letters of credit. As of September 28, 2019 , there were no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement, and the Company was in compliance with all required covenants under the Credit Agreement. As of September 28, 2019 , the Company had $14 million of letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Agreement.

Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus potentially dilutive shares outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive shares are determined by applying the treasury stock method to the assumed exercise of outstanding stock options, the assumed vesting of outstanding Restricted Stock Units (RSUs), the assumed issuance of common shares under the stock purchase plan, and the assumed exercise of the warrant under the Warrant Agreement with WCH prior to the exercise of the warrant on February 13, 2019. Potentially dilutive shares issuable upon conversion of the 2.125% Notes are calculated using the if-converted method. The following table sets forth the components of basic and diluted earnings per share: Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 28, 2019 September 29, 2018 September 28, 2019 September 29, 2018 (In millions, except per share amounts) Numerator Net income $ 120 $ 102 $ 171 $ 299 Denominator Basic weighted-average shares 1,097 987 1,075 976 Effect of potentially dilutive shares: Employee equity incentive plans and warrants 20 89 32 82 Diluted weighted-average shares 1,117 1,076 1,107 1,058 Earnings per share: Basic $ 0.11 $ 0.10 $ 0.16 $ 0.31 Diluted $ 0.11 $ 0.09 $ 0.15 $ 0.28 Potential shares from employee equity incentive plans and the conversion of the 2.125% Notes totaling 101 million for the three months ended September 28, 2019 were not included in the earnings per share calculation because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive.

Contingencies Zeng Shareholder Derivative Lawsuit On March 8, 2018, a purported shareholder derivative lawsuit captioned Zeng v. Su, et al., Case No. 18CIV01192 was filed against the Company (as a nominal defendant only) and certain of its directors and officers in the San Mateo County Superior Court of the State of California. The complaint purports to assert claims against the Company and certain individual directors and officers for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, abuse of control, gross mismanagement and waste of corporate assets. The complaint seeks damages allegedly caused by alleged materially misleading statements and/or material omissions by the Company and the individual directors and officers regarding Spectre, which statements and omissions, the plaintiffs claim, allegedly operated to artificially inflate the price paid for AMD's common stock during the period. On April 26, 2018, the lawsuit was transferred to Santa Clara County and assigned a new case number, 18CV327692. On August 14, 2018, the Court stayed this lawsuit pending a decision on the motion to dismiss in Kim et al. v. AMD, et al., Case No. 3:18-cv-00321 filed against the Company in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California (Securities Class Action). As discussed above, on May 23, 2019, the court in the Securities Class Action granted a motion to dismiss filed by the Company and certain individual officers and thereafter entered final judgment dismissing the Securities Class Action with prejudice. On June 17, 2019, the court in this case entered a joint stipulation to extend the stay until October 7, 2019. On September 5, 2019, the court granted the parties' joint stipulation of dismissal. Based upon information presently known to management, the Company believes that the potential liability, if any, will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. In re Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Shareholder Derivative Litigation Two purported shareholder derivative lawsuits were filed against the Company (as a nominal defendant only) and certain of its directors and officers in the United States District Court, Northern District of California: (1) Jacqueline Dolby, derivatively on behalf of AMD, Inc. v. Su et al., Case No. 5:18-cv-03575, filed on June 14, 2018; and (2) Gusinsky Trust, derivatively on behalf of AMD, Inc. v. Su et al., Case No. 5:18-cv-03811, filed on June 26, 2018. The complaints purport to assert claims against the Company and certain individual directors and officers for violation of Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and SEC Rule 14a-9, breach of fiduciary duty, waste of corporate assets, and unjust enrichment. The complaints seek damages purportedly caused by alleged materially misleading statements and/or material omissions by the Company and the individual directors and officers regarding Spectre. The plaintiffs allege that these statements and omissions operated to artificially inflate the price paid for AMD's common stock during the period. On July 12, 2018, the court consolidated the Dolby and Gusinsky Trust shareholder derivative lawsuits under the caption In re Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Shareholder Derivative Litigation. On August 10, 2018, the Court stayed this lawsuit pending a decision on the motion to dismiss in Kim et al. v. AMD, et al., Case No. 3:18-cv-00321 filed against the Company in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California (Class Action). As discussed above, on May 23, 2019, the court in the Class Action granted a motion to dismiss filed by the Company and certain individual officers and thereafter entered final judgment dismissing the Class Action with prejudice. On June 12, 2019, the court in this case entered a joint stipulation to extend the stay until October 7, 2019. On August 1, 2019, the court granted the parties' voluntary dismissal. Based upon information presently known to management, the Company believes that the potential liability, if any, will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. MediaTek Litigation MediaTek, Inc. v. Advanced Micro Devices , Inc., No. 19-cv-368 in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. On February 21, 2019, MediaTek, Inc. filed suit against the Company, alleging infringement of six patents related to memory controllers and integrated circuit structures. On April 15, 2019, the Company filed a motion to dismiss portions of MediaTeks complaint. On April 29, 2019, MediaTek filed an amended complaint. On May 13, 2019, AMD filed a motion to dismiss part of MediaTek's amended complaint. Subsequently, the parties agreed to dismiss the lawsuit and the Court granted the parties' request on September 24, 2019. On March 18, 2019, AMD Products (China) Co., Ltd. was provided with four complaints filed by MediaTek in the Intermediate Peoples Court of Shenzhen, China. Each complaint alleges infringement of one patent by certain AMD entities, identifies an exemplary product, and seeks injunctive and monetary relief. AMD subsequently initiated invalidity proceedings regarding each of the patents-in-suit. The parties are now in the process of mutually dismissing each of the infringement and invalidity proceedings as well. Based upon information presently known to management, the Company believes that the resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. Dickey Litigation On October 26, 2015, a putative class action complaint captioned Dickey et al. v. AMD, No. 15-cv-04922 was filed against the Company in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. Plaintiffs allege that the Company misled consumers by using the term eight cores in connection with the marketing of certain AMD FX CPUs that are based on the Company's Bulldozer core architecture. The plaintiffs allege these products cannot perform eight calculations simultaneously, without restriction. The plaintiffs seek to obtain damages under several causes of action for a nationwide class of consumers who allegedly were deceived into purchasing certain Bulldozer-based CPUs that were marketed as containing eight cores. The plaintiffs also seek attorneys fees. On December 21, 2015, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, which was granted on April 7, 2016. The plaintiffs then filed an amended complaint with a narrowed putative class definition, which the Court dismissed upon the Company's motion on October 31, 2016. The plaintiffs subsequently filed a second amended complaint, and the Company filed a motion to dismiss the second amended complaint. On June 14, 2017, the Court issued an order granting in part and denying in part the Company's motion to dismiss, and allowing the plaintiffs to move forward with a portion of their complaint. On March 27, 2018, plaintiffs filed their motion for class certification. On January 17, 2019, the Court granted plaintiffs motion for class certification. The class definition does not encompass the Company's Ryzen TM or EPYC TM processors. On January 31, 2019, the Company filed a petition in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals seeking review of certain aspects of the January 17, 2019 class certification order. On May 9, 2019, the parties attended mediation and reached a tentative settlement. The tentative settlement is subject to a final executed agreement and court approval. On June 3, 2019, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals denied the Companys petition seeking appellate review of the January 17, 2019 class certification order. On August 9, 2019, the parties executed a settlement agreement. On August 23, 2019, Plaintiffs filed their motion for preliminary approval of the settlement agreement. On October 4, 2019, the Court granted the motion for preliminary approval of the settlement agreement. Based upon information presently known to management, the Company believes that the settlement will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. Quarterhill Inc. Litigation On July 2, 2018, three entities named Aquila Innovations, Inc. (Aquila), Collabo Innovations, Inc. (Collabo), and Polaris Innovations, Ltd. (Polaris), filed separate patent infringement complaints against the Company in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. Aquila alleges that the Company infringes two patents (6,239,614 and 6,895,519) relating to power management; Collabo alleges that the Company infringes one patent (7,930,575) related to power management; and Polaris alleges that the Company infringes two patents (6,728,144 and 8,117,526) relating to control or use of dynamic random-access memory, or DRAM. Each of the three complaints seeks unspecified monetary damages, interest, fees, expenses, and costs against the Company; Aquila and Collabo also seek enhanced damages. Aquila, Collabo, and Polaris each appear to be related to a patent assertion entity named Quarterhill Inc. (formerly WiLAN Inc.). On November 16, 2018, AMD filed answers in the Collabo and Aquila cases and filed a motion to dismiss in the Polaris case. On January 25, 2019, the Company filed amended answers and counterclaims in the Collabo and Aquila cases. On July 22, 2019, the Company's motion to dismiss in the Polaris case was denied. On August 23, 2019, the Court held a claim construction hearing in each case. Based upon information presently known to management, the Company believes that the potential liability, if any, will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, cash flows or results of operations. Other Legal Matters The Company is a defendant or plaintiff in various actions that arose in the normal course of business. With respect to these matters, the Company believes that the amount or range of reasonably possible loss, if any, will not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations.\""
