       "[\"The outline of the project Domestic myeonbangjik industry since liberation has a long history in the industry who has led the country's industrial development and many companies that take advantage of cheap labor through the past 70 to 80's, the labor-intensive industries entered the cotton spinning industry with new the expanded facility size and has achieved the highest peak. But is this competitiveness due to the cheap products imported from shortages and underdeveloped countries are weighted Entering the '90s, many companies have been culled in recent years to seek new development around the restructuring of companies and some businesses successful product specialization There is. Sales of myeonbangjik industry has reduced consumption in accordance with the domestic economic slowdown if the domestic form to supply the basic raw material for the textile industry and exports to overall sales to decrease in export orders and inventories increased and profitability in accordance with the developed countries, the economic recovery is delayed the environment is a difficult situation. Also, I have some difficulty to secure the profitability there is a limit to cost reduction because the main raw material is cotton of cotton because it relies on imports to 100%, depending on the exchange rate or fluctuations and crop moving to price sensitive occupy a large share of the production costs is. Under these circumstances the domestic myeonbangjik industry to avoid duplicate production and developing advanced-type fibers and to transform the industry value-added product development and achieve the profitability and differentiate into specialized manufacturing productivity continues to promote the complementary and automation of aging facilities and strive to be ahead of the market advantage over developing countries in terms of quality. Status of Company 1) Sales Survey about the past first half of 2011, but Korea's economy has maintained a good economic recovery open at least 5% by 1Q11 2Q12 example as economic growth slowed, with increased uncertainty about the global economic recovery by 3.7% in the first half of the total in will be expected to exhibit growth. In addition, due to the second quarter of lift again surfaced in Europe's debt crisis and Japan's earthquake crisis, the US debt limit increase negotiating hiatus was sparked dollar in 2011 after, but the average of 30% per export growth from the first quarter of 2011 supported by the Korea Economy and it expects significant decline is due to the continued sluggish consumption more than 4% higher rate of inflation does not appear to be significantly improved in the second half of 2011. But it seems the gradual decline such conclusion the second half of debt negotiations in the United States and Greece supported not with a default concerns have decreased to approve such financial crisis risk is somewhat reduced by triggering the inflation of grain prices weakened as also tightening by the Chinese government gradually We view the economic recovery in the second half of the U-shape. The domestic textile industry enjoyed a huge boom to the first quarter of 2011. For the second quarter as earnings slowed significantly with the sharp decline in cotton prices are sending a hard time. This temporary Former world consumption is recovering as the first half of textile exports growth, but export restriction policies in India some off about 22.3% yarn price to show a geuprakse buyers also cycle is repeated while Aspen yarn purchase put to more trouble just look out to show a gradual recovery in the fourth quarter in anticipation of competitiveness and the FTA and an EU FTA due to automation equipment investment in the second half of the domestic textile industry. We are due to the synergies that have been promoted in the meantime, the production facility rationalization work has achieved good results in the first half. Gwangju plant has achieved the highest productivity based on the latest facility will be devoted to doubling its production capacity also increased capex this year. Yong factory also raise productivity and expand the amenities will contribute to nature and maximize profits by power plants and value-added products meniscus is also trying to retain a competitive edge. But we will overcome the difficult circumstances through a company-wide cost reduction efforts for a more aggressive sales strategy and improved competitiveness, but due to the external environment challenges concern increased sales and reduced inventory. The first half of the domestic retail market saw a form that is affordable consumption spread is the consumer sentiment as inflation and interest rates. In Times Square, the company achieved a variety of significant renal and impress customers with the Republic of Korea NO.1 Brand Mall through active marketing activities to increase more than 10% year-on-year sales and operating profit to meet customer satisfaction-oriented customers. 2011 will try to aim for steady revenue growth through a variety of marketing for customer satisfaction in the second half. 2011 business environment is expected to have many difficulties such fluctuations and exchange rate issues in international commodity prices, but to overcome the crisis together the wisdom of both defending their families and paved the way to a greater leap to will open a new era of defending. 2) market share, we fabrics, hosiery, socks, production of yarn and finished yarn such as yarn and various clothing materials of footwear products manufactured raw materials production sales as companies and real estate leasing companies that make up the domestic 28%, export 72% (LOCAL : 64%, DIRECT: consists of 8%). 2010 sales, including sales leasing million, has achieved the export USD120,490 $ 5,000 and including the current lease sales date of this report written record 144,922 million, exports USD66,762. 3) domestic spinning machines (spinning machine) holdings nine minutes defending the same spinning forward for textile eseuji Chungnam room Daenong pungan spinning reserve Facilities Ring OE (MVS) system Share (%) 95,760 130,924 160,608 35,520 40,320 49,008 31,104 480 80 1,920 96 240 131 004 162,528 35,520 40,320 49,008 31,104 7.62% 10.38% 12.88% 2.81% 3.19% 3.88% 2.46% refurbishment Textile Eastern life Nam Textile Taekwang three days weaving Shinhan Rooms state forward zhou room diva Total 184,320 30,000 45,248 120,768 41,216 65,760 51,840 128,640 37,632 1,248,668 1,280 1,200 1,100 3,088 320 1,592 2,592 13,652 185,600 30,000 46,448 121,868 44,304 66,080 51,840 130,232 40,224 1,262,320 14.70% 2.38% 3.68% 9.65% 3.51% 5.23% 4.11% 10.32% 3.19% 100.00% ※ Association of Textile equipment survey (2011 07, excluding idle facility million,%) sales ratios products products by product Division, including surface-door / sales type lease Items specific purpose main brands:) 3. major products and services: 1) (unit of major products Others (including rental income) Yarns, Yarns poryu, poryu.

       " \"Business Overview (1) myeonbangjik industrial domestic myeonbangjik industry has a long history in the industry who has led the country's industrial development after the liberation many who take advantage of the cheap labor through the past 70-80's in labor intensive industries, companies are newly It enters the cotton spinning industry scale expanding the facility has achieved the highest peak. But is this competitiveness due to the cheap products imported from shortages and underdeveloped countries are weighted Entering the '90s, many companies have been culled in recent years to seek new development around the restructuring of companies and some businesses successful product specialization There is. Sales of myeonbangjik industry has reduced consumption in accordance with the domestic economic slowdown if the domestic form to supply the basic raw material for the textile industry and exports to overall sales to decrease in export orders and inventories increased and profitability in accordance with the developed countries, the economic recovery is delayed the environment is difficult mouth. There are also some difficulties to ensure the profitability there is a limit to cost reduction because the main raw material is cotton of cotton because it relies on imports to 100%, depending on the exchange rate or fluctuations and crop moving to price sensitive occupy a large share of the production costs . Under these circumstances the domestic myeonbangjik industry to avoid duplicate production and developing advanced-type fibers and to transform the industry value-added product development and achieve the profitability and differentiate into specialized manufacturing productivity continues to promote the complementary and automation of aging facilities and strive to be ahead of the market advantage over developing countries in terms of quality. (2) The retail industry in Korea retail industry is based on the traditional market in the 1950s, supermarkets and department stores in the 1960s and discount stores in the 1980s, convenience stores, retailers, specialty shops, 1990, hypermarkets, internet shopping, shopping in the 2000s, this theme had emerged shopping mall, which is compared with the current global department store is a time difference of about 90 years, discount stores by 45 years, retail malls look the difference between 5-10 years of generational change is gradually shrinking. The retail industry is themed who enlargement and commercialization as department stores, discount stores, convenience stores all have competition becomes also fierce among the deepening being home to the top three companies, the 2000s appeared shoots Wuhu in order to enhance the product purchase history with the opening of the retail market shopping mall is not as expected long-term growth in the real estate market downturn began receiving new shopping complex is illuminated. Shopping complex is a reproduction of activation or urban functions perfectly By developing a large parcel to it in order to play its central functions gradually hollowing and non-efficiency as part of a complex development projects break a small development method consisting in historical cities with multiple uses It was used, and a lot of roles to improve the urban environment by enabling the efficient use of land and upgrading of urban functions. Korea is now the new mall if they go to the heyday of the shopping complex enough to not be an exaggeration to say that competition is becoming increasingly fierce, and you can experience the shopping, culture, based on a lease are increasing in their number. Times Square, which is the Korea's first advanced composite Store You are out to lead the industry with efficient management and operation of the shopping complex of oil industry through the crystals,. Which had the status (1) Business Survey of recovery after the global financial crisis, the company's global economy affects the whole of the oil crisis in southern Europe occurred rojon 2011, to reduce the global demand today. This wave over China, etc. which collapsed 12 years second quarter economic growth rate of 8% developed countries around the world makronhan slowdown in the emerging markets in emerging countries has been continued until the first half of 2012. Although the United States is showing a slight growth in the number of FIELD, including consumption, but employment is expected to limit the growth in demand contraction of the world are expected to not be able to avoid a slowdown in growth in the second half of the year. The domestic economy is expected to be another growth weakens export demand contraction of the eurozone risks, I say expect domestic demand also decreased due to bad consumer sentiment shoes, household debt is expected to spend a difficult period in the second half. The domestic textile industry faced in 2011 profitability to plunge in imports of yarn prices are formed yarn prices lower, depending on the downward stabilization of this year, cotton prices high inventory cotton used raw materials and yarn inventory burden, with the worsened profitability due to the price difference in the deohaejyeo I'll put the poor performance until 2Q12. This trend seems to be for some time cotton spinning industry is committed to lead the times before trying to improve profitability. We are committed to the ex-factory productivity and profitability to cope with the recession of the world economy and cotton spinning industry in 2012. Yong factory is one -EU, along with a wide range of product development - and expects improved profits by producing one product leveraging the Korea-US FTA, Guangzhou factory is focused on improving profitability through cost reduction due to productivity improvements coming. Crescents factories also committed to cost savings through equipment improvements and restructuring are underway in line with the plant without even a factory in Vietnam in 2012 completion target problem. 1H12 earnings distribution industry made a performance declined due to the continuing economic instability at home and abroad, over temperature phenomena such as consumption sentiment persists among the overall year-on-year. Duty Free has showed increased and although a record high sales with an increase in foreign tourist turnover of the main department store industry earnings fell 0.8% YoY in overseas travelers, hypermarket industry is a large shop duty in addition to the economic downturn the effects of such hyumuje saw a 2.5% decline year-on-year performance. Times Square Also, depending on the economic impact of the kidney did not show significantly made a slight year-on-year in ad revenue with President importer kidney performance based on improved space worthy of Times Square. Times Square is effectively was through the store management do their best to improve customer satisfaction, which centralizes strategic brands, with minimal store vacancies, by number of rows successfully the MD reorganization made in the second half of weathering the economic downturn at home and abroad to achieve the goals We will be doing our best to help. In the second half of 2012, but expect a lot of trouble at home and abroad forces defending employees will gather all the wisdom of the family overcome the crisis in both the textile sector and the business sector in Times Square and cleaned up to provide more good performance furnace.

There are also some difficulties to ensure the profitability there is a limit to cost reduction because the main raw material is cotton of cotton because it relies on imports to 100%, depending on the exchange rate or fluctuations and crop moving to price sensitive occupy a large share of the production costs . Under these circumstances the domestic myeonbangjik industry to avoid duplicate production and developing advanced-type fibers and to transform the industry value-added product development and achieve the profitability and differentiate into specialized manufacturing productivity continues to promote the complementary and automation of aging facilities and strive to be ahead of the market advantage over developing countries in terms of quality.

       " \"The outline of the project Domestic myeonbangjik industry since liberation has a long history in the industry who has led the country's industrial development and many companies that take advantage of cheap labor through the past 70 to 80's, the labor-intensive industries entered the cotton spinning industry with new the expanded facility size and has achieved the highest peak. But is this competitiveness due to the cheap products imported from shortages and underdeveloped countries are weighted Entering the '90s, many companies have been culled in recent years to seek new development around the restructuring of companies and some businesses successful product specialization There is. Sales of myeonbangjik industry has reduced consumption in accordance with the domestic economic slowdown if the domestic form to supply the basic raw material for the textile industry and exports to overall sales to decrease in export orders and inventories increased and profitability in accordance with the developed countries, the economic recovery is delayed the environment is a difficult situation. Also, I have some difficulty to secure the profitability there is a limit to cost reduction because the main raw material is cotton of cotton because it relies on imports to 100%, depending on the exchange rate or fluctuations and crop moving to price sensitive occupy a large share of the production costs is. Under these circumstances the domestic myeonbangjik industry to avoid duplicate production and developing advanced-type fibers and to transform the industry value-added product development and achieve the profitability and differentiate into specialized manufacturing productivity continues to promote the complementary and automation of aging facilities and strive to be ahead of the market advantage over developing countries in terms of quality. Company Status 1) Business Survey of the past first half of 2011, the world economy was due to excessive spending in showed me the financial crisis the process seemed to temporarily recover from the economic stimulus of the country increased the debt of major economies significantly, especially in southern Europe, some countries my default until the situation molrimyeo are again showing disturbing signs that the global economy. US and Euro and other developed countries is expected to slow economic recovery, emerging economies such as China are still modest, but growth is expected to expected until the economic slowdown and reduced exports if the advanced economies will inevitably slow down sharply. Accordingly, the impact of the rapid economic recovery in the economy also seemed Korea look to be a downside risk to the global economy continued expanding in accordance with the gradual employment growth increases the exports of emerging real economy among the OECD countries is expected to be limited. Since anticipation the domestic textile industry enjoyed a huge boom to the first quarter of 2011. 2Q12 example that while export restrictions policy in India is off transient yarn inventories unwound this year cotton crop seen a brisk while cotton prices have plunged the sales price of yarn It was such a sell-off phenomenon is expected to be difficult to recover in the short term. Accordingly, the domestic cotton spinning industry was slowing earnings showed up in the second quarter of the year is generally spend hard times. Just one-to-US FTA and the expectations of the -EU FTA next year, look out to show a gradual recovery. We are due to the synergies that have been promoted in the meantime, the production facility rationalization work has significantly contributed to improved productivity. Gwangju plant has achieved the highest productivity and finishing equipment replacement until the third quarter Yong factory will also expand the facility raising the productivity power of high value-added products for the equipment characteristics contribute to maximizing profits crescents factories also hold a competitive edge can we try to. But we will overcome the difficult circumstances through a company-wide cost reduction efforts to improve competitiveness and increase the difficulty and more aggressive sales strategy, but reduced revenue due to inventory concerns in the external environment. Landmark nestled in Times Square in Yeongdeungpo was constantly growing through a variety of events and the summer holidays special to celebrate the grand opening two years in the third quarter of 2011, especially in the fashion and miscellaneous goods sector is stabilized with a single high sales growth of 20% YoY the appearance that it seemed. In addition, we will make even greater efforts to expect stable sales growth in other sectors by constantly attracting new MD excavated in jipgaekryeok. 2) Market Share Status (domestic spinning Equipments) Category defending the same spinning forward for textile eseuji Chungnam room Daenong pungan textile renovate textile Eastern Life Taekwang three days held in total textile Shinhan Rooms state forward zhou room diva Facilities Ring OE (MVS) system share (%) 110 160 123 724 160 608 35 520 40 320 49 008 31 104 184 320 30 000 120 768 41 216 65 760 51 840 128 640 37 632 480 80 1920 1.21062 million. 1100 3088 320. 1592 3024 12,884 110,640 123,804 162,528 35,520 40,320 49,008 31,104 185,600 30,000 121,868 44,304 66,080 51,840 130,232 40,656 1,223,504 9.04% 10.12% 13.28% 2.90% 3.30% 4.01% 2.54% 15.17% 2.45% 9.96% 3.62% 5.40% 4.24% 10.64 % 3.32% 100.00% ※ Association of Textile equipment survey (2011, except for 10 the end, idle facilities) 3.

But is this competitiveness due to the cheap products imported from shortages and underdeveloped countries are weighted Entering the '90s, many companies have been culled in recent years to seek new development around the restructuring of companies and some businesses successful product specialization There is. Sales of myeonbangjik industry has reduced consumption in accordance with the domestic economic slowdown if the domestic form to supply the basic raw material for the textile industry and exports to overall sales to decrease in export orders and inventories increased and profitability in accordance with the developed countries, the economic recovery is delayed the environment is difficult mouth. There are also some difficulties to ensure the profitability there is a limit to cost reduction because the main raw material is cotton of cotton because it relies on imports to 100%, depending on the exchange rate or fluctuations and crop moving to price sensitive occupy a large share of the production costs . Under these circumstances the domestic myeonbangjik industry to avoid duplicate production and developing advanced-type fibers and to transform the industry value-added product development and achieve the profitability and differentiate into specialized manufacturing productivity continues to promote the complementary and automation of aging facilities and strive to be ahead of the market advantage over developing countries in terms of quality.

The retail industry is themed who enlargement and commercialization as department stores, discount stores, convenience stores all have competition becomes also fierce among the deepening being home to the top three companies, the 2000s appeared shoots Wuhu in order to enhance the product purchase history with the opening of the retail market shopping mall is not as expected long-term growth in the real estate market downturn began receiving new shopping complex is illuminated. Shopping complex is a reproduction of activation or urban functions perfectly By developing a large parcel to it in order to play its central functions gradually hollowing and non-efficiency as part of a complex development projects break a small development method consisting in historical cities with multiple uses It was used, and a lot of roles to improve the urban environment by enabling the efficient use of land and upgrading of urban functions. Korea is now the new mall if they go to the heyday of the shopping complex enough to not be an exaggeration to say that competition is becoming increasingly fierce, and you can experience the shopping, culture, based on a lease are increasing in their number. Times Square, which is the Korea's first advanced composite Store You are out to lead the industry with efficient management and operation of the shopping complex of oil industry through the crystals,. Status: (1) slow growth trend of the global economy derived from sales in the last Survey 2011 financial crisis in Europe and the United States in the company is not even hard to improve until the second half of the year. And the financial deterioration of the southern European countries to reduce the demand affects the peripheral European countries, the United States is the effect of the stimulus measures such as quantitative easing are expected to fall short of expectations. A decline in demand in developed countries trade gravity high growth emerging markets such as China and the developed countries are also slowing. Korea economy Externally, exports decreased and internally include the system are expected to domestic anxiety in consumer sentiment deteriorated due to the debt increases, etc. not reach the original of growth such as the IMF and the Bank of Korea lowered the expected GDP growth rate. The domestic textile industry in 2011, as was the yarn price to oversupply caused by the yarn export restrictions off in India plunged ha cotton supply situation improved since, but nuryeot a big boom, while the hawk is soaring, with skyrocketing in the first quarter of imported yarn prices profitability has deteriorated sharply up cotton prices in raw materials and product inventory burden. In 2012, however, due to the yarn produced by high raw material inventory at the time of wear loss, inventories have been consuming much of the long term is expected to regain profitability, cotton spinning industry is committed to the distribution efforts for a more rapid recovery profitability There is. We are trying to pick the entire plant productivity and profitability to cope with the recession of the world economy and cotton spinning industry in 2012. Yong factory is expected to improve profit by production using a variety of product development and FTA, Guangzhou factory will strive to minimize the cost by improving productivity through the latest equipment.

Q3 2012 retail industry is boyigido but some signs of recovery due to the holiday in the domestic and international economic instability persists were closed with a slight decline year-on-year performance across the industry could not overcome, especially fashion goods sector middle of the pitch, the luxury department store brand sales also slowed growth in de aspect that continues to be sluggish. Times Square also made a new open, eoteuna you are in construction, etc. According to the MD reorganization reduced sales factors, the previous year was a slight elongation results in improved efficiency due to the successful MD reorganization of the commercial district in competition with Sim Tuesday's consumer sentiment. In addition, it also showed a tendency to rise steadily coronation events and advertising revenue continued to improve the value of the space. Times Square will do our best to keep the location of the first in the fierce competition between the MD and the efficient management reorganization mall overcome the downturn in consumer systems that meet the needs of consumers.

       " \"Overview ● myeonbangjik industrial domestic myeonbangjik industry released since Korea has a long history in the industry who has led the industry and cotton spinning industry, many companies utilizing cheap labor through the past 70 to 80's, the labor-intensive industries to new businesses by entering the plant scale it is expanding has achieved the highest peak. But is this competitiveness due to the cheap products imported from shortages and underdeveloped countries are weighted Entering the '90s, many companies have been culled in recent years to seek new development around the restructuring of companies and some businesses successful product specialization There is. Sales of myeonbangjik industry has reduced consumption in accordance with the domestic economic slowdown if the domestic form to supply the basic raw material for the textile industry and exports to overall sales to decrease in export orders and inventories increased and profitability in accordance with the developed countries, the economic recovery is delayed the environment is difficult mouth. There are also some difficulties to ensure the profitability there is a limit to cost reduction because the main raw material is cotton of cotton because it relies on imports to 100%, depending on the exchange rate or fluctuations and crop moving to price sensitive occupy a large share of the production costs . Under these circumstances the domestic myeonbangjik industry to avoid duplicate production and developing advanced-type fibers and to transform the industry value-added product development and achieve the profitability and differentiate into specialized manufacturing productivity continues to promote the complementary and automation of aging facilities and strive to be ahead of the market advantage over developing countries in terms of quality. ● retail industrial country distribution industry is based on the traditional market in the 1950s, supermarkets and department stores in the 1960s and discount stores in the 1980s, convenience stores, retailers, specialty shops, 1990, hypermarkets, internet shopping, shopping in the 2000s, thematic the mall had emerged, which is compared with the current global department store is a time difference of about 90 years, discount stores by 45 years, retail malls look the difference between 5-10 years of generational change is gradually shrinking. The retail industry is themed who enlargement and commercialization as department stores, discount stores, convenience stores all have competition becomes also fierce among the deepening being home to the top three companies, the 2000s appeared shoots Wuhu in order to enhance the product purchase history with the opening of the retail market shopping mall is not as expected long-term growth in the real estate market downturn began receiving new shopping complex is illuminated. Shopping complex it is used for the reproduction of the active and perfectly functional CBD by developing a large parcel in complex applications to break a small development method consisting in the past shown to play a base function to be gradually cavitation and non-efficient, as part of a complex development It was, and a lot of role in the urban environment improved by enabling advanced features of the city and also the efficient use of land. 2000's second half and were shopping complex concept stores are a number of shopping complex since the mid-2000s appeared since the emergence of the shopping complex This is one and 'shopping, entertainment and business as a group of stores more than the sum of floor space 3,000㎡ features where it is integrated, and its role as a cultural and tourist facilities have been granted the legal meaning of a single supplier development, management and operation of groups of stores. Even though Korea is now going to the heyday of the shopping complex enough to not be an exaggeration to say that the new mall competition can be fierce and getting me to experience the shopping, culture, based on a lease are increasing in the number of. That can be developed as Korea's first mall-type complex in Times Square, we must get out of the clothing retail industry crystals as efficient management and operation of shopping malls lead the industry. ● Real Estate Consulting keonseoltingeop our country has repeated its steady growth during. In particular, in the 1990s, land Since then, interest on long-term income while moving away from the real estate investment practices for selling real estate rental, etc. through the use and utilization of real estate holding period increases downturn has also continued to increase demand for real estate consulting . But, yet real estate keonseoltingeop the view mothayeo relevant qualifications and based on legislation the situation is the exact business areas or activities being organized by insufficient lower business profitability lively entry and exit of the related enterprise market as one of the professional industry, you can see that as circumstances that still stay in infancy. Accordingly, an international real estate consulting company utilizing advanced techniques and one after another they are entering the country, a situation that also fierce competition becomes engaged with the real estate market. JEDI is trying to exit the chaff from the competition by combining the Times Square operation know-how on the basis of previous experience and know-how in the present day. Company Status ● Business Survey 1) (Note) defending South Korea's economy cease on the last global financial crisis after the rapid recovery of the looks I showed seemed to take to stabilize the unexpected overseas to negative and Europe of 3.8% growth in the financial crisis, the impact of 2011 2012 is expected to face a more difficult recession risks increased. The world economy is global cooperation after, due to the aftermath of the massive fiscal spending and some European countries to take austerity measures contraction of the euro area real economy sharply and growth is expected to significantly decline Because of this gradual seemed recovering US economy also contracted There is a developed country exports, China is expected to put hwadoel sharply. But is the government bond maturing of the PIGS countries concentrated in the first half of 2012 there has been response to the crisis in the world actively, China, also the world economic shocks while turning the policy into domestic demand stimulus from policy-oriented export the second half It is expected to be somewhat mitigated. 2011 textile industry was plunging yarn prices, oversupply due to export restrictions off in India after but nuryeot a big boom, while the hawk is soaring, with soaring imports of yarn prices from the first quarter, raw cotton supply situation is improved while cotton prices the sharp decline until myeonbangjeok domestic companies have been largely profitability in trouble as a raw material and product inventory burden. In 2012 he spent a year in line with the economic slowdown in the textile industry appears to be far improved significantly. We continue to invest parties raise their competitiveness despite the severe 2011 recession in the textile industry to improve productivity has been focused on improving profitability. Guangzhou factory was to maximize productivity by finishing equipment replacement until the third quarter, Yong plant increased productivity through equipment improvements and, and, and, and gain a competitive edge by focusing on value-added products improve the crescents factories also plant efficiency when the potential Chapter strives to achieve revenue maximization through development. In addition, more than that for the competition of the world was entering Vietnam to the start of overseas investment is progressing factory finished with summa cum laude line goal by the end of 2012. The production facility rationalization work promoting far out synergies from 2012 We expect to achieve improved performance. Times Square is a half mark the second anniversary of opening in 2011 was a significant increase in sales compared to the previous year, the company achieved an enemy against the opening of a new competitor into a good store stabilize and strengthen customer marketing room half. Also saw tangible results, even through a variety of affiliate marketing and increase overall customer overseas promotion of foreign tourists, including my room. 2012 Times Square is despite intense competition and opening new rules of competition and Category cementing the brand value of 'Republic of Korea No.1 shopping' and do our best to ensure competitiveness. 2012 business environment will be, but many at home and abroad, such as the global economic uncertainty, the difficulty expected to achieve a sustainable growth of textile yarn business unit profitability and Times Square sectors gathered the wisdom of both defending their families overcome the crisis and greater leap Lets do our distribution efforts. 2) Ltd defending distributors middle of last year the retail industry is the first half of michimyeo in the stock market boom and improved consumption capacity under the influence of such, but to achieve good growth deuleoseomyeo the second half of the European debt crisis continues to gomulga including impact of oil through the industry the growth compared to the first half of consumption, such as the contraction has slowed. However, the downturn in consumer values \\u200b\\u200band trends are spreading necessities seemed to have a strong luxury sales department, while the norm, and the popularity of luxury prefer the low-cost. 2011 sales of department stores are only a slowdown in the global economy, according to the financial crisis in Europe made leads to contraction of the real economy, but recorded a slight juchumhan growth in 2H than in 2010 continued to grow even in each part of the turnaround from the previous year increase has been this year's new suyocheung including younger and male customers in accordance with the will try to prevent the churn of customers differentiated strategies, so that intensified competition expected in accordance with the subsequent opening of its competitors in the nearby commercial district, especially shopping complex demand the establishment of a strategy to absorb the demands of various customers in improving MD reinforcing and services including SPA brand in accordance with, and also to stimulate the amenities and reinforcing demand for foreign tourists increased continuously in the Korean influence southwest of commercial distribution by focusing on the development of promotions We will try to make it one that established itself as the core of the business. 3) JEDI 2011 years ago, the world view of the overall downturn atmosphere react, the real estate investment market segment, followed by 6% in investments in the US and Europe compared to real estate investments in 2010 increased earnings due to increased economic uncertainty caused by the European debt crisis and that, in 2012, we expect a slight increase. Also, it looks to maintain the euro falling trend in the commercial real estate sector is expected to recover from the perspective of Asian and US long-term. China's real estate market in 2011 will increase in real estate prices in the strengthening of regulations to control the activation and the inter-company mergers and acquisitions in progress, but it is lively and overheated real estate market of commercial real estate transactions, gains have been suppressed. Japanese real estate market in the impact of such enterprise Tal Japanese developer and yen resulting crazy negative impact on the market downturn long-term due to the tsunami and radioactive leakage from Fukushima nuclear power plant occurred in March 2011 the long-term growth rate also but declined expected you said you expect to support the government's long-term recovery. South Korea has led the real estate market crisis, but details such as trying to activate the real estate market of several measures in a long-term recession surge in charter rates and savings banks and construction companies due to poor PF will fit bankruptcy. On the other hand I received the attention the Urban Housing and office building, shopping complex etc. monetize new estate. We are in an economic situation, recession by promoting the Korea market actively through hand Times Square and collaborative branding Tuesday to consulting to develop commercial facilities samgo year of project-based deployment founding in 2011, since its founding in 2010 as a comprehensive enemies It was achieved by adding a sales target overseas markets activities also with all the power expansion in China and Japan was based on the business. 2012 We plan to pursue business plan with the goal of first-class' plans, strengthening the design ability to work and strengthen the overall capabilities and capacity to pursue the project comprehensively.

Division Company Name Main goods and services Samyang Samyang Genex Samyang Mill Max food sector Samyang well food sugar, high-sweetness sweeteners, olive oil, starch, starch, sugar alcohols, functional foods flour, premixes margarine, shortening, cooking oil Qinhuangdao Samyang Genex Food Co., Ltd. starch Seven Springs, Samyang food and Dining Samyang chemical division Samnam petrochemical Samyang Mars Samyang Inno-Chem Trading division Samyang Holdings Samyang bio farm, Samyang Genex bio other sectors Samyang Research (SRC) Family restaurant Bakery cafe engineering plastics for industrial material fibers PET bottles, PET bottles recycling, ion exchange resins, TPA (Terephthalic Acid) PCR (Polycarbonate resin) BPA (Bisphenol A) trade paechwije, medical devices anticancer drug research Samyang Entech papermaking machinery, industrial machinery, environmental equipment Samyang data systems Telecommunications (1 ) division into 1) the food sector) abroad most of the characteristics of industrial raw materials Since the sale after processing the document importation has been heavily influenced by the international grain. Raw sugar is sugar, wonmaek flour, oil is primarily used as a raw material, such as cooking oil and margarine. Sugar industry has maintained since the end of 1950 in three of the four systems, Samyang, CJ CJ, sugar and reaching for the current singyujin without operator input, it is because the sugar industry, process industries and slow growth industry. Starch produced by Samyang Genex it is when hydrolyzed polymer material as the former are produced per minute, which is divided into syrup acids, oligosaccharides, glucose, etc., depending on the kind and content of components. The starch can have a wide demand for paper Sizing, cardboard adhesive, fiber sizing agent and pharmaceutical raw materials such as industrial raw materials for the addition of various food and beverage industry. Starch sugar industry, yet the domestic industry is a capital-intensive process industries. Wheat milling industry Samyang Max also the domestic industry is a capital-intensive process industries. Since the basic food material to the sensitivity of the government and large suppliers (food processors) is large and fierce competition between companies for the price increase is weak resilience to fluctuations in raw material prices. Samyang well in food and vegetable oil heating various copper raw material, obtained by processing of crude oil kept pressing, to extract the maintenance of production products such as cooking oil, margarine, shortening,. Maintaining industry is used as raw material for various industrial and domestic food and beverage industry where vegetable oil. B) the growth of the sugar industry industry is fierce competition among industry low growth in mature industrial situations. And continue to explore new markets and promote growth through a variety of methods, including overseas expansion and business cooperation, explore new sales channels. Starch produced by Samyang Genex is generated by this product as a raw material, intermediate goods, rather than as a consumer under are a wholesale company in the country and in major markets. The domestic consumption more than 90% of the whole, you influenced by fluctuations in sales of downstream industries due to the economic changes typical domestic industry. Domestic wheat flour market Samyang Max is the domestic business market growth is the situation that is static. Samyang Food Processing maintain production at the wells has a baking company as wholesaler in the country to produce this product as a raw material, intermediate goods, rather than as a major consumer market. Also greatly it affected the game of downstream industries due to the economic fluctuations in the domestic industry. C) You only attribute sugar industry cyclicality is not the inflexible nature that is largely unaffected by economic fluctuations than other industries external factors such as international grain and exchange rate fluctuations can be variables that affect the sales and income. Starch products produced by Samyang Genex is to the consumer as non-essential grocery life with inflexible nature of the economic cycle. Starch industry is growing at a rapid maturity is also difficult to expect a stable piece seasonal fluctuations. Maintaining production at mill products and food produced in Sanyang Sanyang Wells Mill Max products are all non-food products resilient to economic fluctuations as a base material. For maintaining business confectionery market boom in the winter period, and holy is the summer off-season. D) are the three companies of the sugar market in the domestic and international market conditions, Samyang\\'s CJ CJ, sugar to form a competitive market. Raw material sugar are mainly imported from Australia, Guatemala, Thailand. Amid this market and encroaching threat of substitute sweeteners such as fructose lingering strives to maintain and secure sales channels. Starch market Samyang Genex is there and the four companies of the sugar target, CPK, CJ Cheil form a competitive market, raw corn are mainly imported from the United States, China, and South America. Had recently won due to the burden of high oil prices, the market encroachment of imported starch, the continuation of sluggish domestic economy, such as business environment is becoming more difficult there, and is intensifying the competitive intensity among companies. Samyang Mill Max CJ CJ, for milling, milling Korea, Dong-won, presidential milling, Samhwa milling, milling, etc. Nam and the company and the competition wonmaek raw materials are imported from the US, Australia and Canada. For well Samyang Foods margarine, shortening, are competing with Lotte Samkang, Ottogi are competing with companies such as soybean oil, etc. CJ CJ, New Oriental, Ottogi. Maintaining industry but little growth in mature industries, in recent years there is growing consumer interest in health-related and deal with trans-fat reducing product development in the industry. E) focuses on the purchase, production, sales and enhance the overall marketing activities ranging from surveillance to ensure excellence and customers and sales of value-added products, competitive factors between food businesses. Strives to create a variety of profitability on a stable revenue base through the continuous expansion of new businesses and new markets not. Samyang are tailored to the food industry trend to look for the latest wellness deal with various aspects, such as launching an organic, low-calorie and low-fat products. It also limited to the existing portfolio of electronic materials division Oro is working on an excavation and the profitability and revenue through a variety of food groups, it is difficult integration synergies flexible response to changes in the external environment. B2C as well as plans to strengthen R & D core competencies in order to secure the leadership category of food business, expand the business and home-made new categories and strengthen its distribution capacity and foster B2C businesses as new growth engines for Food contact. This allows to extend the existing sugar, flour, business, etc., etc. Based on the technology of the materials sector homemade retail, catering material distribution, first and material circulation and maintain excavated for future growth performed the role of a Total Solution Provider The planned. Samyang Genex is incorporated told the restaurant business, etc., and to expand into adjacent businesses trying to build a sustainable competitive advantage in the food business, catering company, The Seven Springs in April 2006 the Group Sanyang series. Samyang Mill Max has been manufacturing a variety of products such as fortified wheat flour to enhance the vitamins and iron losses in the milling and fortification information through the facility in Asan factory equipped with the most advanced flour production equipment. And it is pre-mixed with other additives to the main ingredient for the production of flour premix products that consumers can eat it very easy to cook. Samyang Foods maintains business well is to go out with a range of international grain variables of sales and profit, but a lot of things, enhance its competitiveness in cost reduction activities and new product development. 2) chemical sector a) Characteristics of industrial engineering plastics, transparency, heat resistance and mechanical properties compared to general-purpose plastics used in the right flood electronics, automobiles, machine parts and materials has affected the game of downstream industries such as electronics, automobiles . Fibers for industrial materials has been widely used in various fields such as high strength, dimensional stability, the desktop as transport, agriculture, industry, construction and civil durability is closely related to the degree of development of the overall industry. The more developed countries have a variety of industrial development can create demand for many new and varied demands to continue the development of new applications. As a technology-intensive industry with a wealth of high-performance product development, the enhancement of the value available. The container sector PET bottles is my fever, can withstand the pressure bottle with pressure, heat apbyeong withstand the heat and pressure simultaneously, and general illness that can withstand the heat and pressure, depending on how you charge. PET bottles are produced by the production order quantity is important and timely supply capacity, it is important to have a partnership with our customers. Ion exchange resin of the ion resin industry sector to the industrial water treatment applications in large-scale devices based on the technology you are using the default being expanded into a variety of applications, including food, pharmaceuticals, semiconductor and catalyst. The more you demand a lot of chemical and electronic industries developed country, you can create new demand through the development of new applications and existing product improvement. Samnam producing TPA, sold in the petrochemical typically terephthalic acid (Terephthalic Acid) as bulriwoomyeo The p-xylene with pure white powder prepared by the (Para Xylene) the main raw material through the oxidation, purification, separation, drying step purification from crude. TPA is separated by PTA (Pure Terephthalic Acid) and (Qualified Terephthalic Acid) QTA depending on the production process. BPA (Bisphenol A) produced by Samyang Inno-Chem is being used as the main ingredient of PC (Polycarbonate). PC, it can mostly used in applications such as electronic devices, OA devices, automobiles, machine parts. B) The growth of the engineering plastics industry is closely related to global economic growth. In particular, China\\'s demand that the world\\'s factories are concentrated more closely correlated with China\\'s economic growth. When viewed as the industry standard lead the attributes that accompany growth when the demand of downstream industries such as automotive, electronics become enlarged. In accordance with the miniaturization of the end product, integrating the demand of engineering plastics market it is projected to increase. Fibers for industrial materials and applications is expanding demand increases depending on the weight, highly functional, diversification trend of industrial materials and is used as an alternative material, such as price and performance are superior to metal, plastic, paper and minerals. PET bottle container sector is closely related to the growth of the beverage market, replacing the glass bottles and CAN-class market rate. Demand in the market is based on annual growth of 7-10%. In the case of ion exchange resins generic products continued stable growth. In the case of high-value products such as ultra-pure water resin, and resin for the catalyst shows high growth. TPA mainly of polyester fibers, PET resin, film coating and engineering is used as the main raw material, such as plastic, many applications, such as a solid by the various co-current, electric and electronic materials, industrial materials, construction materials, machine parts in heat resistance, abrasion resistance, insulating properties, etc. There has been developed technology sector. Asian market for BPA has been estimated at 300 million tons, led by China, the average annual market growth rate of 7-8% is expected due to increased demand for PC (Polycarbonate). C) the economic characteristics of engineering plastics, such as economic fluctuations is a flow of electrical and electronic and automotive industry, a key demand. We also get a lot of the impact of oil price fluctuations due to the petrochemical as the main raw materials. Fibers for industrial materials itgie used as materials for various industries generally very sensitive to economic fluctuations. Seasonally, the second quarter is the case of the spunbond is a lot of demand for agricultural peak season, if not five grid civil demand is less in summer and winter is the low season. The container sector PET bottles are large differences in seasonal demand and the peak in demand during summer drinks, and sensitive to short game life cycle (Life Cycle) products. Ion exchange resins have characteristics that demand increases in the seasonally dry season in winter, the main demand is sensitive to fluctuations in the chemical and electronics industries. Also affected by the loss due to external factors such as the nature of oil prices as the main raw material for petrochemical products. D) to purchase goods for resale to the PCR (Polycarbonate Resin) produced in a chemical company Samyang Samyang affiliates of the Company\\'s major subsidiaries overseas market conditions or use as an ingredient in compound products. And it produces PBT (Polybutylene Terephthalate) PBT resin are selling or producing products for PBT compounds. For the production of BPA (Bisphenol A) as a raw material in the PCR it was founded Samyang Inno-Chem in 2009 and began commercial production in April 2012. Accordingly, we expect the cost competitiveness of the polycarbonate to be obtained. And fiber for industrial materials sector was strong buying European debt crisis, known as excess supply in accordance with demand reduction and continuous expansion of China in accordance with the Global recession intensified competition in the domestic and export markets and. Spunbond price and quality competition is becoming increasingly fierce as new facilities and expansion of competitors and the actual demand. Geogrid domestic demand will continue to increase and the competition getting fierce with the entry of new companies in accordance with one common technique is getting increasingly difficult market conditions in the road shrinking budgets and excessive competition between companies. If the container has Samyang, five companies of Hyosung, Tech Pack Solutions, one day canning, Lotte Aluminum is supplying about 70% of total demand. The domestic market is intensifying as MK-ridden board production expansion and new facilities introduced in the existing company. Ion exchange resins are showing shortages worldwide. In the case of high-value products that can compete in the international advanced enterprises, for general-purpose products are competitive in China, Indian low-cost mixed resin product. Which accounts for over 80% of the TPA demand for polyester fiber industry, but in Asia, including China, expected stable growth of 6% per annum, a situation that due to the large TPA new and expanded in China and Eastern Europe become competitive . E) competitive factors engineering plastics are heat value can compete with competitors\\' aggressive marketing to improve market share. Continuous and long-term and for the growth and promoting value-added product development and improvement continuous quality and customer contact management, the Chinese subsidiary of Samyang process soryo (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. and Eastern Europe subsidiary of the global market through the Samyang EP Hungary Ltd. the expanding. Industry competitors, the materials for the textile sector are price competition is becoming more intense\\'re pursuing aggressive marketing to improve market share, based on volume expansion. In order to cope and trying to expand sales and improve profitability through quality superiority and differentiated products and gain a competitive advantage through increased productivity and reduced costs. Container sector is committed to improving profitability through development of differentiated products and cost savings that competitors are waging an aggressive expansion and price competition to increase market share. Ion exchange resins and if the value of the product and the technology and services, competition is intensifying, and the case of generic products cost competition is intensifying. Continuous and long-term and to grow internally, efforts to develop high value-added products, continuous quality improvement, the only domestic-oriented and provide a differentiated tried to buy the manufacturing advantages of Maker\\'s customer service. Samnam petrochemical contributes to only by introducing (Qualified Terephthalic Acid) QTA method developed by Mitsubishi Chemical, cost competitiveness, strengthen the competitiveness of the domestic chemical fiber industry by supplying high quality products and economic development in the country. Samnam petrochemical holds the TPA production capacity of 1.8 million tons computing, has sold more than 50% of its production all over the world, including China, the world\\'s largest chemical fiber market. In addition, volumes sold in the domestic chemical fiber raw materials suppliers are also many export purposes. 3) Trade Division Trade Division of Samyang Holdings is responsible for the business of Trading of affiliated products, such as import and export of general goods. Sugar production in Samyang Joe genuine, Samnam terephthalic acid product of the petrochemical (TPA, Terephthalic Acid), affiliates of short fibers produced by Huvis (Staple Fiber), in addition to products of starch produced by Samyang the annex various commodity the local purchase and export to all over the world. Tokyo and Shanghai and New York affiliates promotional products utilizing overseas subsidiaries and affiliates, and materials etc., we constantly develop new items through a local market research and information gathering. 4) Other sectors ① pharmaceutical sector pharmaceutical industry is the whole process of such a direct impact on people\\'s health and life industrial nature drug approval, manufacture and distribution is strictly managed and controlled, especially in the domestic pharmaceutical market is the aging population and society in the security system, including expanding and maintaining a high growth rate. The pharmaceutical industry is relatively inelastic to the economic cycle than in other industries. If the piece receives some influence on the Related fluctuations and seasonal factors, the case of generic drugs, or prescription drugs have a more sensitive nature of such political factors rather than cyclical factors. Recently, the government has implemented a You continually drug regulatory policies such as low purchase incentives, Rive site ssangbeol first, a group listed pharmaceutical bulk drug price cuts. Expand the export of surgical sutures Samyang bio farm in the United States and Europe are mature markets for, and to promote the export contract, the neksol -PM week, the next generation of cancer drugs are working on expanding exports.

Divisional Status (1) ① food sector has received a lot of influence in the international grain imports, because most of the material characteristics of the industry in overseas sales to after processing. Raw sugar is sugar, corn starch, wonmaek flour, oil is primarily used as a raw material, such as cooking oil and margarine. Sugar industry has maintained since the end of 1950 in three of the four systems, Samyang, CJ CJ, sugar and reaching for the current singyujin without operator input, it is because the sugar industry, process industries and slow growth industry. Starch produced by Samyang Genex is when hydrolyzed starch as the polymer material is produced, which is divided into syrup acids, oligosaccharides, glucose, etc., depending on the current composition and content. The starch can have a wide demand for paper Sizing, cardboard adhesive, fiber sizing agent and pharmaceutical raw materials such as industrial raw materials for the addition of various food and beverage industry. Starch sugar industry, yet the domestic industry is capital-intensive equipment industry. Wheat milling industry Samyang Max also the domestic industry is a capital-intensive process industries. Since the basic food material to the sensitivity of the government and large suppliers (food processors) is large and fierce competition between companies for the price increase is weak resilience to fluctuations in raw material prices. Samyang well in food and vegetable oil heating various copper raw material, obtained by processing of crude oil kept pressing, to extract the maintenance of production products such as cooking oil, margarine, shortening. Maintaining industry is used as raw material for various industrial and domestic food and beverage industry where vegetable oil. ② growth of industrial sugar industry is the competition between the industry\\'s low growth potential in mature industries tough situation. And continue to explore new markets and promote growth through a variety of methods, including overseas expansion and business cooperation, explore new sales channels. Starch produced by Samyang Genex is generated by this product as a raw material, intermediate goods, rather than as a consumer under are a wholesale company in the country and in major markets. The domestic consumption more than 90% of the whole, it influenced by fluctuations in sales of downstream industries due to the economic changes typical domestic industry. Domestic wheat flour market Samyang Max is the domestic business market growth is the situation that is static. Samyang Foods also well maintained business and domestic business situation on this market growth is stagnant. ③ nature of the sugar industry are subject to fluctuations variables that affect the external factors, such as sales and profit not only the inflexible nature does not significantly affected by economic cycles than other industries, international grain and exchange rate fluctuations. Starch products produced by Samyang Genex is to the consumer as non-essential grocery life with inflexible nature of the game changes. Starch industry is growing at a rapid maturity is also difficult to expect a stable piece seasonal fluctuations. Maintaining production at mill products and food produced in Sanyang Sanyang Wells Mill Max products are all non-food products resilient to economic fluctuations as a base material. ④ is the rivalries and domestic market conditions, the sugar market is Samyang CJ CJ, for sugar, raw sugar which are mostly imported from Australia, Guatemala, Thailand. Starch market Samyang Genex is competing with the target, IK (Ingredion Korea), CJ CJ, won ryoin corn are mainly imported from the United States, China, and South America. Milling industry and the CJ CJ, milling, milling Korea, Dong-won, presidential milling, milling Samhwa, competing with companies such as milling Nam relationship, wonmaek raw materials are imported from the US, Australia and Canada. For maintaining industrial margarine, shortening, are competing with Lotte Samkang soybean oil, etc. are competing with companies such as Ottogi, east and west. Among the intense competition among companies pursuing growth in a way that continues to enhance new product development competitiveness. Raw material, maintaining crude oil are mainly imported from Argentina, horse-Ray Jia, Canada. ⑤ puts the competition between buying food components businesses, production, sales and enhance the overall marketing activities ranging from surveillance to ensure excellence and focus on customers and sales of value-added products. Strives to create a variety of profitability on a stable revenue base through the continuous expansion of new businesses and new markets not. Samyang is tailored to the food industry trend to look for the latest wellness deal with various aspects, such as launching an organic, low-calorie products and diamond bit and focus on sales expansion and growth. As defined in the existing portfolio of electronic materials division is trying to increase profitability and discover the various sources of revenue synergies through integrated food group because it forces a flexible response to changes in the external environment. The existing section of the party, milling, maintenance, etc. Based on materials technology sector catering material distribution, confectionery materials distribution businesses, including the expansion plan to serve as a Total Solution Provider excavated for future growth. Lorca is planning to strengthen its R & D core competencies for leadership in ensuring food B2C business, business, and home-made weight loss formulas, including new categories expand, strengthen and nurture the yutongryeok B2C businesses as new growth engines for Food contact. Recently starch industry you are in business conditions cost burden due to high oil prices, the market encroachment of imported starch, whether in the domestic recession and faced with such difficulties, the former being the competitive strength of four companies per intensified. Samyang Mill Max has been manufacturing a variety of products such as fortified wheat flour to enhance the vitamins and iron losses in the milling and fortification information through the facility in Asan factory equipped with the most advanced flour production equipment. And it is pre-mixed with other additives to the main ingredient for the production of flour premix product that the consumer can easily just cook. Samyang Foods maintains business well, depending on the fluctuations in international grain variables of sales and income situation is a lot, but recently there have been increasing consumer interest in health and coping with trans fat reduction product development, etc. in. (2) Chemical Sector ① characteristics of industrial engineering plastics and transparency, heat resistance and mechanical properties used in the right flood electronics, automobiles, machine parts and materials compared to general-purpose plastics are affected by the game of downstream industries such as electronics, automobiles . Fibers for industrial materials has been widely used in various fields such as high strength, dimensional stability, the desktop as transport, agriculture, industry, construction and civil durability is closely related to the degree of development of the overall industry. The more developed countries, many developed by various industry demands continue to generate new demand for new and different purposes and development, and technology-intensive industries can enhance the value-added products with high performance as the development. The container sector PET bottles is my fever, can withstand the pressure bottle with pressure, heat apbyeong withstand the heat and pressure simultaneously, and general illness that can withstand the heat and pressure, depending on how you charge. PET bottles are produced by the total volume of production orders is critical partnerships with customers is important and timely supply capacity. Ion exchange resins are a variety of industrial applications for water treatment applications in large-scale industrial equipment based on the technology and basic lead as the food, pharmaceutical, semiconductor, catalysts have been used to enlarge. The more we demand a lot of chemical and electronic industries developed country, you can create new demand through the development and improvement of existing products, new uses. Samnam producing TPA, sold in the petrochemical is typically terephthalic acid (Terephthalic Acid) as bulriwoomyeo the p-xylene produced pure white powder after the oxidation, purification, separation, drying step in the (Para Xylene) main material purified from crude oil. TPA mainly of polyester fibers, PET resin, film coating and engineering is used as the main raw material, such as plastic, many applications, such as a solid by the various co-current, electric and electronic materials, industrial materials, construction materials, machine parts in heat resistance, abrasion resistance, insulating properties, etc. There has been developed technology sector. BPA (Bisphenol A) produced by Samyang Inno-Chem has been used as the main raw material of PC (Polycarbonate) and epoxy resin. PC are mainly used in applications such as electronic devices, OA devices, automobiles, machine parts, epoxy resins are used in applications such as inner coating, electrical and electronic parts, construction materials for corrosion protection of metals. ② growth of engineering plastics industry is closely related to global economic growth. In particular, Chinese demand in the world\\'s factories are concentrated many have a close correlation with the growth in China\\'s economy. When viewed as industry-standard attributes that accompany growth when the demand of downstream industries such as automotive, electronics become enlarged. In accordance with the miniaturization of the end product, integrating the demand of engineering plastics market it is expected to increase treat. Fibers for industrial materials and applications is expanding demand increases depending on the weight, highly functional, diversification trend of industrial materials and is used as an alternative material, such as price and performance are superior to metal, plastic, paper and minerals. PET bottle container sector is closely related to the growth of the beverage market and replace the vial and the CAN market. By product, you are increasing the demand for spring water bottles and my fever (tea, coffee, juseuryu) .. In the case of ion exchange resins generic products continued stable growth. In the case of high-value products such as ultra-pure water resin, the resin catalyst shows strong growth. Asian market for BPA has been estimated at 300 million tons, led by China, the average annual market growth rate of 7-8% is expected due to increased demand for PC (Polycarbonate). ③ economic characteristics of engineering plastics in the economic cycle is, as the flow of the game, and the electronic and automobile industry, the main consumer. We also get a lot of the impact of oil price fluctuations due to the petrochemical as the main raw material. Fibers for industrial materials itgie used as materials for various industries generally very sensitive to economic fluctuations. Seasonally, the second quarter is the case of the spunbond is a lot of demand for agricultural peak season, if not five grid civil demand is less in summer and winter is the low season. The container sector PET bottles are large differences in seasonal demand and the peak in demand during summer drinks, and sensitive to short game life cycle of a product (Life Cycle). Ion exchange resins have characteristics that demand increases in the seasonally dry season in winter, the main demand is sensitive to fluctuations in the chemical and electronics industries. BPA because it is a major supplier Polycarbonate industry demand being a significant effect on the flow of the game industry, and has a close relationship with the price of phenol and acetone is used as the main ingredient. ④ The Samyang for the domestic and international market conditions, the Company\\'s main subsidiaries by purchasing resale PCR (Polycarbonate Resin) produced by the Mars family Samyang company product or use as an ingredient in compound products. And it produces PBT (Polybutylene Terephthalate) PBT resin are selling or producing products for PBT compounds. For the production of BPA (Bisphenol A) as a raw material in the PCR it was founded Samyang Inno-Chem in 2009 and began commercial production in April 2012. Living and industrial strength of materials for the textile sector due to oversupply in the ongoing expansion of the middle of the demand decline in Europe\\'s global economic instability Country You are intensifying competition in the domestic and export markets. The spunbond can compete in price and quality, new equipment and expansion of competitors and the actual demand is becoming increasingly fierce. Geogrid is price competitive with additional entry of new companies is intensifying, etc., while the domestic demand is stagnant medium-sized manufacturers. If the container has a sales competition is intensifying in production expansion and new facilities introduced in the existing company. Ion exchange resins are showing shortages worldwide. In the case of high-value products that can compete in the international advanced enterprises, is the case of a commodity trend is intensifying competition in China, the Indian low-cost products. Polyester textile industry, which accounts for over 80% of the TPA demand, but in Asia, including China, expected stable growth of 6% per annum, a situation that becomes competitive due to the large TPA new and expanded in China and Eastern Europe. ⑤ competitive factors engineering plastics are ridden around by fierce expansion and aggressive marketing of its competitors for improving market share. And promoting sustainable and long-term growth for the Si-PC, including high value-added product development and support continuous quality improvement and customer contact management, strive for cost competitiveness. In addition, through a subsidiary in China, which Samyang process soryo (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. and Eastern European subsidiary Samyang EP Hungary Ltd. is expanding the global market. Industry competitors, the materials for the textile sector are becoming increasingly fierce price competition\\'re pursuing aggressive marketing to improve market share based on the volume expansion. In order to cope and trying to expand sales and improve profitability through quality superiority and differentiated products and gain a competitive advantage through increased productivity and reduced costs. Container sector is committed to improving profitability through differentiated product development and cost reduction. Ion exchange resins and if the value of the product and the technology and services, competition is intensifying, and the case of generic products cost competition is intensifying. Continuous and strive for long-term growth with internally, high value-added product development and continuous quality improvement-oriented and provide a differentiated customer service alive advantage of the only domestic manufacturer.

Divisional Status (1) ① food sector has received a lot of influence in the international grain imports, because most of the material characteristics of the industry in overseas sales to after processing. Raw sugar is mainly used as raw materials such as sugar, corn starch, flour wonmaek. Sugar industry has maintained since the end of 1950 in three of the four systems, Samyang, CJ CJ, sugar and reaching for the current singyujin without operator input, it is because the sugar industry, process industries and slow growth industry. Starch produced by Samyang Genex is when hydrolyzed starch as the polymer material is produced, which is divided into syrup acids, oligosaccharides, glucose, etc., depending on the current composition and content. The starch can have a wide demand for paper Sizing, cardboard adhesive, fiber sizing agent and pharmaceutical raw materials such as industrial raw materials for the addition of various food and beverage industry. Starch sugar industry, yet the domestic industry is capital-intensive equipment industry. Wheat milling industry Samyang Max also the domestic industry is a capital-intensive process industries. Since the basic food material to the sensitivity of the government and large suppliers (food processors) is large and fierce competition between companies for the price increase is weak resilience to fluctuations in raw material prices. ② growth of the sugar industry industry is fierce competition among industry low growth in mature industrial situations. And continue to explore new markets and promote growth through a variety of methods, including overseas expansion and business cooperation, explore new sales channels. Starch produced by Samyang Genex is a subsidiary raw products to them as raw as an intermediary rather than consumer goods are a wholesale company in the country and in major markets. The domestic consumption more than 90% of the whole, it influenced by fluctuations in sales of downstream industries due to the economic changes typical domestic industry. Domestic wheat flour market Samyang Max is the domestic business market growth is the situation that is static. ③ nature of the sugar industry are subject to fluctuations variables that affect the external factors, such as sales and profit not only the inflexible nature does not significantly affected by economic cycles than other industries, international grain and exchange rate fluctuations. Starch products produced by Samyang Genex is to the consumer as non-essential grocery life with inflexible nature of the game changes. Starch industry is growing at a rapid maturity is also difficult to expect a stable piece seasonal fluctuations. Flour Mill Max product produced by Samyang is inelastic to economic fluctuations as a basic food material. ④ is the rivalries and domestic market conditions, the sugar market is Samyang CJ CJ, for sugar, raw sugar which are mostly imported from Australia, Guatemala and Thailand. Starch market Samyang Genex is competing with the target, IK (Ingredion Korea), CJ CJ, won ryoin corn are mainly imported from the United States, China, and South America. Flour Market Samyang Mill Max is the CJ CJ, milling, Korea Flour Mills, Dong-won, presidential milling, competing with the business of Samhwa milling, Yeungnam milling, etc. for raw material of wonmaek galaxy imported from the United States, Australia, Canada and There is. ⑤ puts strengthen the overall marketing activities leading to competition between buying food components businesses, production, sales and follow-up and ensure excellence and focus on customers and sales of value-added products. Strives to create a variety of profitability on a stable revenue base through the continuous expansion of new businesses and new markets not. Samyang is tailored to the food industry trend to look for the latest wellness deal with various aspects, such as launching an organic, low-calorie products and diamond bit and focus on sales expansion and growth. As defined in the existing portfolio of electronic materials division is trying to increase profitability and discover the various sources of revenue synergies through integrated food group because it forces a flexible response to changes in the external environment. It plans to an existing chapter of the sugar, flour, maintaining technological fields, including materials based on material distribution in the catering, bakery ingredients business, including distribution of accurate and excavated for future growth acts as a Total Solution Provider. Recently starch industry is facing difficult business conditions in the direct market encroachment of imported starch, such as continued sluggish domestic economy, the competitive strength of a minute ago four companies is intensifying. Samyang Mill Max has been manufacturing a variety of products such as fortified wheat flour to enhance the vitamins and iron losses in the milling and fortification information through the facility in Asan factory equipped with the most advanced flour production equipment. And it is pre-mixed with other additives to the main ingredient for the production of flour premix product that the consumer can easily just cook. (2) Chemical Sector ① is widely even for this characteristic engineering plastics transparency, heat resistance and mechanical properties compared to general-purpose plastics industry, as well as materials such as Wu flood electronics, automotive, medical, security, machinery optics used as a state-of-the-art high-performance materials that influenced the game of downstream industries such as electronics, automobiles. Fibers for industrial materials is a high strength, dimensional stability, has been widely used in various fields such as the desktop as transport, agriculture, industry, civil construction and durability are closely related to the degree of development of the overall industry. The more developed countries, many developed by various industry demand will continue to create new and the high demand for a variety of new applications development, and technology-intensive industries are part of the enhanced value through the development of high-performance products as possible. The container sector PET bottles is my fever, can withstand the pressure bottle with pressure, heat apbyeong withstand the heat and pressure simultaneously, and general illness that can withstand the heat and pressure, depending on how you charge. PET bottles are produced by the production order quantity is important and timely supply capacity, it is important to have a partnership with our customers. Ion exchange resins are a variety of industrial applications for water treatment applications in large-scale industrial equipment based on the technology and basic lead as the food, pharmaceutical, semiconductor, catalysts have been used to enlarge. The more we demand a lot of chemical and electronic industries developed country, you can create new demand through the development and improvement of existing products, new uses. Samnam producing TPA, sold in the petrochemical typically terephthalic acid (Terephthalic Acid) as bulriwoomyeo The p-xylene with pure white powder prepared by the (Para Xylene) the main raw material through the oxidation, purification, separation, drying step purification from crude. TPA mainly of polyester fibers, PET resin, film coating and engineering is used as the main raw material, such as plastic, many applications, such as a solid by the various co-current, electric and electronic materials, industrial materials, construction materials, machine parts in heat resistance, abrasion resistance, insulating properties, etc. There has been developed technology sector. BPA (Bisphenol A) produced by Samyang Inno-Chem has been used as the main raw material of PC (Polycarbonate) and epoxy resin. PC are mainly used in applications such as electronic devices, OA devices, automobiles, machine parts, epoxy resins are used in applications such as inner coating, electrical and electronic parts, construction materials for corrosion protection of metals. ② growth of engineering plastics industry is closely related to global economic growth. In particular, Chinese demand in the world\\'s factories are concentrated many have a close correlation with China\\'s economic growth. When viewed as industry-standard attributes that accompany growth when the demand of downstream industries such as automotive, electronics become enlarged. In particular, the recent material according to the weight trend of the automotive sector being replaced by high-performance plastic products is an increasing demand that is expected in . Fibers for industrial materials and applications is expanding demand increases depending on the weight, highly functional, diversification trend of industrial materials and is used as an alternative material, such as price and performance are superior to metal, plastic, paper and minerals. PET bottle container sector is closely related to the growth of the beverage market and replace the vial and the CAN market. By product is expected to increase the demand for spring water bottles and my fever (tea, coffee, juseuryu). In the case of ion exchange resins generic products continued stable growth. In the case of high-value products such as ultra-pure water resin, and resin for the catalyst shows strong growth. Asian market for BPA has been estimated at 300 million tons, it is expected to be led by China, that demand for PC (Polycarbonate) and epoxy resin increased slightly. ③ economic characteristics of engineering plastics in the economic cycle is, as the flow of the game, and the electronic and automobile industry, the main consumer. We also get a lot of the impact of oil price fluctuations due to the petrochemical as the main raw material. Fibers for industrial materials itgie used as materials for various industries generally very sensitive to economic fluctuations. Seasonally, in the case of the spunbond and the second quarter is the peak season for agriculture needs much, if not five grid civil demand is less in summer and winter low season. The container sector PET bottles are large differences in seasonal demand and the peak in demand during summer drinks, and sensitive to short game life cycle (Life Cycle) products. Ion exchange resins have characteristics that demand increases in the seasonally dry season in winter, the main demand is sensitive to fluctuations in the chemical and electronics industries. BPA because it is a major supplier Polycarbonate industry demand being a significant effect on the flow of the game industry, and has a close relationship with the price of phenol and acetone is used as the main ingredient. ④ The Samyang for the domestic and international market conditions, the Company\\'s main subsidiaries by purchasing resale PCR (Polycarbonate Resin) produced by the Mars family Samyang company product or use as an ingredient in compound products. And it has produced a PBT (Polybutylene Terephthalate) PBT resin or sell produce PBT compounds products. Living and industrial strength of materials for the textile sector of the demand decline in Europe\\'s global economic instability due to excess supply in the continuous expansion of China are intensifying competition in the domestic and export markets. Spunbond will we price and quality competitive with new facilities and expansion of competitors and the actual demand is becoming increasingly fierce. Geogrid is price competitive with additional entry of new companies is intensifying, etc., while the domestic demand is stagnant medium-sized manufacturers. If the container has a sales competition is intensifying in production expansion and new facilities introduced in the existing company. Ion exchange resins are showing shortages worldwide. In the case of high-value products that can compete in the international advanced enterprises, is the case of a commodity trend is intensifying competition in China, the Indian low-cost products. Samyang Inno-Chem has a BPA (Bisphenol A) as a raw material for PCR from April 2012 sales, etc. Samyang Mars. BPA has been profitable for manufacturers to dramatically worsen oversupply of the expansion, a situation that becomes competitive. Polyester textile industry, which accounts for over 80% of the TPA demand, but in Asia, including China, expected stable growth of 6% per annum, a situation that becomes competitive due to the large TPA new and expanded in China and Eastern Europe. ⑤ competitive factors engineering plastics are ridden around by fierce expansion and aggressive marketing of competing for market share, improve. And promoting sustainable and long-term growth for the Si-PC, including high value-added product development and support continuous quality improvement and customer contact management, strive for cost competitiveness. In addition, through a Chinese subsidiary of Samyang process soryo (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. and Eastern European subsidiaries in Hungary Samyang EP is expanding the global market. Industry competitors, the materials for the textile sector are becoming increasingly fierce price competition\\'re pursuing aggressive marketing to improve market share based on the volume expansion. In order to cope and trying to expand sales and improve profitability through quality superiority and differentiated products and gain a competitive advantage through increased productivity and reduced costs. Container sector is committed to improving profitability through differentiated product development and cost reduction. Ion exchange resins and if the value of the product and the technology and services, competition is intensifying, and the case of generic products cost competition is intensifying. Internally consistent and to ensure long-term growth and value-added products and development, oriented to continuous quality improvement and strive for differentiated customer service by taking advantage of the only domestic manufacturer. Samnam petrochemical contributes to only by introducing (Qualified Terephthalic Acid) QTA method developed by Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation, strengthening the competitiveness of domestic chemical fiber industry by providing superior cost competitiveness, quality of products and economic development in the country. Samnam petrochemical holds the TPA production capacity of 1.8 million tons computing, has sold more than 50% of its production all over the world, including China, the world\\'s largest chemical fiber market. In addition, volumes sold in the domestic chemical fiber raw materials suppliers are also many export purposes. (3) Commercial Division of Samyang Holdings Trading Division is responsible for the import and export of some affiliate products. In the Samyang production of sugar Joe genuine, Samnam terephthalic acid product of the petrochemical (TPA, Terephthalic Acid), relations addition product of starch production at short fibers (Staple Fiber) produced in the company, Huvis, Samyang Genex variety of general merchandise the local purchase and export to all over the world. Tokyo, and a group of companies and product promotions to take advantage of the overseas branches and subsidiaries that materials such as Shanghai, New York, and constantly develop new items from the current not market research and information gathering. (4) Other sectors ① pharmaceutical sector pharmaceutical industry is the whole process of a direct impact on people\\'s health and life, nature drug approval in the industrial, manufacturing, and distribution is strictly managed and controlled, the Pharmaceutical Affairs Law and psychotropic drugs laws, good manufacturing standards (KGMP), superior pharmaceutical distribution management standards (KGSP), in addition to a large number of alternative regulatory preparations, such as covering the mayakbeop affected by the various government policies such as drug price rationalization measures. International pharmaceutical market is showing a steady growth of 6-8% per year, the steady growth in recent years it is expected to surge in the demand of the market, including timers Gong in China. Domestic pharmaceutical market in medical services expectations rise and its response medicines were global growth in 14 of the top right market research enabled, such as about 300 domestic pharmaceutical companies and multinationals of about 40 to 18 that trillion due to increased economic level and competition in the domestic market. Study the public health directly associated with the drug is relatively inelastic to the cyclical nature compared to other industries, the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry. For the case of generic medicines cyclical and seasonal factors affected the soda side or prescription drugs under the rather cyclical factors have a more sensitive characteristics such as political factors. Most of the domestic pharmaceutical companies have focused on the research and development capabilities and investment generic (bokjeyak) products are patent expires at low levels compared to the developed countries, drug development is the marketing competitive situation compared to other industries. In October 2010 the introduction of low-cost purchase incentives, a generic agent as ribeyi ssangbeol the enforcement, such as in November 2010 the unfavorable environment in the domestic pharmaceutical\\'ve been strong growth in the domestic market, and Composition It is expected that changes in the structure of the generics business center. The pharmaceutical industry is the sum required by the business of human life as collateral, strict quality control and technology. Samyang Bio farm through strict quality tests for cancer drug raw materials in the manufacturing facilities for the European and Japanese pharmaceutical production equipment standards and the stable supply of the finished medicinal use other domestic and, expanding exports to the surgical suture American and European markets and strive to expand exports, etc. to promote the export contract, the neksol -PM week, the next generation of cancer drugs. In addition, the Ministry of Health and Welfare certified and have been selected in the \"Innovative pharmaceutical companies. ② Samyang Samyang Entech Entech is the machine business and the business environment, the main business. Hardware is the capital goods industry, which is the basis of all industries, water treatment plants in the environment business characteristics that demand fluctuates greatly depending on the game situation, such as plant construction project to purify the feed and contaminated water of the water required for plant you have.

Division Company Name Main goods and services Samyang Samyang Genex Samyang Mill Max food sector Samyang well food sugar, high-sweetness sweeteners, olive oil, starch, starch, sugar alcohols, functional foods flour, premixes margarine, shortening, cooking oil Qinhuangdao Samyang Genex Food Co., Ltd. starch Seven Springs, Samyang food and Dining Samyang chemical division Samnam petrochemical Samyang Mars Samyang Inno-Chem Trading division Samyang Holdings Samyang bio farm, Samyang Genex other sectors Samyang Research (SRC) Family restaurant Bakery cafe engineering plastics and industrial materials textile PET bottles , PET bottle recycling, ion exchange resins, TPA (Terephthalic Acid) PCR (Polycarbonate resin) BPA (Bisphenol A) trade paechwije, medical devices anticancer drug research Samyang Entech papermaking machinery, industrial machinery, environmental equipment Samyang data systems Telecommunications (1) division into 1) the food sector) may most of the characteristics of the raw materials industry from abroad Because the mouth Buy After processing, we get a lot of influence in the international grain. Sugar, imported by the wonmaek, crude oil, etc. There is a primary processing of raw sugar is sugar, wonmaek is used as a raw material such as wheat flour, crude oil and margarine. The sugar industry, there is currently nearing the end of the 1950s after the maintenance of the system into three four Samyang, CJ Cheil Sugar, Sugar for operators without singyujin mouth, it is because the sugar industry, process industries and slow growth industry. Starch produced by Samyang Genex it is when hydrolyzed polymer material as the former are produced per minute, which is divided into syrup acids, oligosaccharides, glucose, etc., depending on the kind and content of components. The starch can have a wide demand for paper Sizing, cardboard adhesive, fiber sizing agent and pharmaceutical raw materials such as industrial raw materials for the addition of various food and beverage industry. Starch sugar industry, yet the domestic industry is a capital-intensive process industries. Wheat milling industry Samyang Max also the domestic industry is a capital-intensive process industries. Since the basic food material to the sensitivity of the government and large suppliers (food processors) is large and fierce competition between companies for the price increase is weak resilience to fluctuations in raw material prices. Samyang well in food and vegetable oil heating various copper raw material, obtained by processing of crude oil kept pressing, to extract the maintenance of production products such as cooking oil, margarine, shortening,. That the oil at room temperature to a liquid state (油, oil), not being a solid state (脂, fat), and soybean oil, palm oil, such maintenance processing is used as a main component, such as edible oil, butter, and shortening. Oils that are used as raw materials for various food and beverage industries and businesses while maintaining the domestic industry is capital-intensive equipment industry. B) the growth of the sugar industry industry is fierce competition among industry low growth in mature industrial situations. And continue to explore new markets and promote growth through a variety of methods, including overseas expansion and business cooperation, explore new sales channels. Starch produced by Samyang Genex is a subsidiary raw products to them as raw as an intermediary rather than consumer goods are a wholesale company in the country and in major markets. The domestic consumption more than 90% of the whole, it influenced by fluctuations in sales of downstream industries due to the economic changes typical domestic industry. The size of the domestic market of milling wheat Samyang Max is the annual processing capacity level of about 220 million tons, domestic business and market growth is the situation that is static. The domestic market for processed maintain production at Samyang Foods wells is approximately 100,000 tons per year. Consumer requires an intermediate rather than the main baking company as wholesaler in the country in which it produces the raw material for the product and the market. Also it receives a lot of impact on the game ahead of the industry in accordance with fluctuations in the domestic industry. C) You only attribute sugar industry cyclicality is not the inflexible nature that is largely unaffected by economic fluctuations than other industries external factors such as international grain and exchange rate fluctuations can be variables that affect the sales and income. Maketingryeok manufacturing costs and strengthening, it focused on improving profitability through such an active market. Starch products produced by Samyang Genex is an essential foodstuff in life have the inflexible nature of the environment variable group compared to the consumer. Starch industry is growing at a rapid maturity is also difficult to wait for a stable piece seasonal fluctuations. Maintaining the product produced in the milling products and food produced in Sanyang Sanyang Wells Mill Max is a formula based on both material inelastic to economic fluctuations. For maintaining business confectionery market boom of the winter season and the summer is low season. D) conditions of the domestic sugar market, Samyang has been produced by the three major domestic sugar, CJ CJ, are doing sugar and competing for. Raw material sugar are mainly imported from Australia, Guatemala and Thailand. Amid this market and encroaching threat of substitute sweeteners such as fructose lingering strives to maintain and secure sales channels. Starch market Samyang Genex is there and the four companies of the sugar target, CPK, CJ Cheil form a competitive market, raw corn are mainly imported from the United States, China, South America. Had recently won due to the burden of high oil prices, the market encroachment of imported starch, the continuation of sluggish domestic economy, such as business environment is becoming more difficult there, and is intensifying the competitive intensity among companies. Samyang Mill Max CJ CJ, for milling, milling Korea, Dong-won, presidential milling, Samhwa milling, milling, etc. Nam and the company and the competition wonmaek raw materials are imported from the US, Australia and Canada. For well Samyang Foods margarine, shortening, are competing with Lotte Samkang, welga are competing with companies such as soybean oil, sugar, etc. CJ second one, New Oriental, Ottogi, Samyang maintained. Maintaining industry but little growth in mature industries, in recent years there is growing consumer interest in health-related and deal with trans-fat reducing product development in the industry. E) focuses on the purchase, production, sales and enhance the overall marketing activities ranging from surveillance to ensure excellence and customers and sales of value-added products, competitive factors between food businesses. Strives to create a variety of profitability on a stable revenue base through the continuous expansion of new businesses and new markets not. Samyang Corporation is focused on sales expansion and growth by actively reviewing the food industry, according to a recent trend to look for well-being and coping with various aspects, such as launching an organic, low-calorie and low-fat products, strategic alliances and M & A, etc. Also it has a limited portfolio of existing materials sector efforts to improve profitability and discover a variety of revenue sources through integration synergies food groups it is difficult for flexible response to changes in the external environment. As well as B2C said food fortification and R & D core competencies in order to secure the leadership category of the business, expand the business and home-made new categories and strengthen yutongryeok plans to develop a B2C businesses as new growth engines for Food contact. This is planned to be based on the technology of such materials sector existing sugar, flour, maintain, expand home-made distribution, catering material distribution, projects such as confectionery material distribution and excavated for future growth acts as a Total Solution Provider. Samyang Genex is incorporated told the restaurant business, etc., and to expand into adjacent businesses trying to build a sustainable competitive advantage in the food business, catering company, The Seven Springs in April 2006 the Group Sanyang series. Samyang Mill Max has been manufacturing a variety of products such as fortified wheat flour to enhance the vitamins and iron losses in the milling and fortification information through the facility in Asan factory equipped with the most advanced flour production equipment. And it is pre-mixed with other additives to the main ingredient for the production of flour premix products that consumers can eat it very easy to cook. Samyang Foods maintains business well, depending on the fluctuations in international grain variables of sales and income situation is a lot, but it has been constantly improved results year-on-year profitability was carried out in a manufacturing cost reduction activities, such as cost leadership. We are strengthened competitiveness by developing new products and continued cost reduction activities, etc.. 2) chemical sector a) Characteristics of industrial engineering plastics, transparency, heat resistance and mechanical properties compared to general-purpose plastics used in the right flood electronics, automobiles, machine parts and materials has affected the game of downstream industries such as electronics, automobiles . Fibers for industrial materials has been widely used in various fields such as high strength, dimensional stability, the desktop as transport, agriculture, industry, construction and civil durability is closely related to the degree of development of the overall industry. The more developed countries, many developed by various industry demands technology-intensive industries and can create a variety of new demand continued to develop new applications. As a technology-intensive industries it can enhance the added value through high-performance products. PET bottle container sector is of my fever, can withstand the pressure bottle with pressure, heat apbyeong withstand the heat and pressure simultaneously, and general illness that can withstand the heat and pressure, depending on how you charge. PET bottles are produced by the production order quantity is important and timely supply capacity, it is important to have a partnership with our customers. Ion exchange resin ion resin industry sector you by the water treatment applications in large-scale industrial equipment based on the technology used in the basic and expanded in a variety of applications, including food, pharmaceutical, semiconductor, catalyst. The more we demand a lot of chemical and electronic industries developed country, you can create new demand through the development and improvement of existing products, new uses. Samnam producing TPA, sold in the petrochemical is typically terephthalic acid (Terephthalic Acid) as bulriwoomyeo the p-xylene produced pure white powder after the oxidation, purification, separation, drying step in the (Para Xylene) main material purified from crude oil. TPA is divided into PTA (Pure Terephthalic Acid) and (Qualified Terephthalic Acid) QTA depending on the production process. BPA (Bisphenol A) produced by Samyang Inno-Chem is being used as the main ingredient of PC (Polycarbonate). PC, it can mostly used in applications such as electronic devices, OA devices, automobiles, machine parts. B) The growth of the engineering plastics industry is closely related to global economic growth. In particular, Chinese demand in the world\\'s factories are concentrated, the more closely correlated with the growth in China\\'s economy. When viewed as the industry standard lead the attributes that accompany growth when the demand of downstream industries such as automotive, electronics become enlarged. In accordance with the miniaturization of the end product, integrating the demand of engineering plastics market it is expected to increase. Fibers for industrial materials and applications is expanding demand increases depending on the weight, highly functional, diversification trend of industrial materials and is used as an alternative material, such as price and performance are superior to metal, plastic, paper and minerals. PET bottle container sector is closely related to the growth of the beverage market, replacing the glass bottles and CAN-class market rate. Demand in the market is based on annual growth of 7-10%. In the case of ion exchange resins generic products continued stable growth. In the case of high-value products such as ultra-pure water resin, and resin for the catalyst shows strong growth. TPA mainly of polyester fibers, PET resin, film coating and engineering is used as the main raw material, such as plastic, many applications, such as a solid by the various co-current, electric and electronic materials, industrial materials, construction materials, machine parts in heat resistance, abrasion resistance, insulating properties, etc. There has been developed technology sector. Asian market for BPA has been estimated at 300 million tons, led by China, the average annual market growth rate of 7-8% is expected due to increased demand for PC (Polycarbonate). C) the economic characteristics of engineering plastics, such as economic fluctuations is a flow of electrical and electronic and automotive industry, a key demand. It also affected by oil price fluctuations due to the petrochemical as the main raw material. Fibers for industrial materials itgie used as materials for various industries generally very sensitive to economic fluctuations. Seasonally, the second quarter is the case of the spunbond is a lot of demand for agricultural peak season, if not five grid civil demand is less in summer and winter is the low season. The container sector PET bottles are large differences in seasonal demand and the peak in demand during summer drinks, and sensitive to short game life cycle (Life Cycle) products. Ion exchange resins have characteristics that demand increases in the seasonally dry season in winter, the main demand is sensitive to fluctuations in the chemical and electronics industries. Also affected by the loss due to external factors such as the nature of oil prices as the main raw material for petrochemical products. D) to purchase goods for resale to the PCR (Polycarbonate Resin) produced in a chemical company Samyang Samyang affiliates of the Company\\'s major subsidiaries overseas market conditions or use as an ingredient in a compound product. And it produces PBT (Polybutylene Terephthalate) PBT resin are selling or producing products for PBT compounds. For the production of BPA (Bisphenol A) as a raw material in the PCR it was founded Samyang Inno-Chem in 2009 and began commercial production in April 2012. Accordingly, we expect the cost competitiveness of the polycarbonate to be obtained. Industry and powerful live competition in the European debt crisis reduced demand and a supply glut in accordance with the continuous expansion of China in accordance with the Global Recession domestic and export markets for the materials the textile sector, it is deepening. Spunbond price and quality competition is becoming increasingly intense, with new facilities and expansion of competitors, actual demand. Geogrid domestic demand will continue to increase and the competition getting fierce with the entry of new companies in accordance with one common technique is getting increasingly difficult market conditions in the road shrinking budgets and excessive competition between companies. If the container has Samyang, five companies of Hyosung, Tech Pack Solutions, one day canning, Lotte Aluminum is supplying about 70% of total demand. The domestic market is intensifying as MK-ridden board production expansion and new facilities introduced in the existing company. Ion exchange resins are showing shortages worldwide. In the case of high-value-added products and to compete in the international advanced enterprises, for general-purpose products in China, Indian low-cost and competitive product mix resins. Polyester fibers, which accounts for over 80% of the TPA demand industry, but in Asia, including China, expected stable growth of 6%, a situation that due to the large TPA of new and expansion in China and Eastern Europe become competitive. E) The competitive factors engineering plastics fierce price competition and aggressive marketing to improve the market share of its competitors. Continuous, and promote the long-term to grow internally, high value-added product development and support continuous quality improvement and customer contact management, and externally is expanding its sales in China subsidiary Samyang process small fee (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. Eastern Europe (Hungary ) to promote the globalization, such as the establishment of a subsidiary Samyang EP Hungary. Industry competitors, the materials for the textile sector are becoming increasingly fierce price competition\\'re pursuing aggressive marketing to improve market share based on the volume expansion. In order to cope and trying to expand sales and improve profitability through quality superiority and differentiated products and gain a competitive edge through improved productivity and cost reduction. Container sector is committed to improving profitability through development of differentiated products and cost savings that competitors are waging an aggressive expansion and price competition to increase market share. In the case of ion exchange resin technology, high value-added products and services, and competition is intensifying, and the case of generic products cost competition it is intensifying. Internally consistent and to ensure long-term growth and Govou are trying to develop valuable products, continuous quality improvement-oriented and differentiated customer service by taking advantage of the only domestic manufacturer Maker. Samnam petrochemical contributes to only by introducing (Qualified Terephthalic Acid) QTA method developed by Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation, strengthening the competitiveness of domestic chemical fiber industry by providing superior cost competitiveness, quality of products and economic development in the country. Samnam petrochemical operations and holds the TPA production capacity of 180 tons, has sold more than 50% of its production all over the world, including China, the world\\'s largest chemical fiber market. In addition, volumes sold in the domestic chemical fiber raw materials suppliers are also many export purposes. 3) Trade Division Trade Division of Samyang Holdings is responsible for the business of Trading of affiliated products, such as import and export of general goods. Sugar production in Samyang Joe genuine, Samnam terephthalic acid product of the petrochemical (TPA, Terephthalic Acid), affiliates of short fibers produced by Huvis (Staple Fiber), in addition to products of starch produced by Samyang the annex various commodity the local purchase and export to all over the world. Tokyo and Shanghai and New York affiliates promotional products utilizing overseas subsidiaries and affiliates, and materials etc., we constantly develop new items collected through the local market research and information. 4) Other sectors ① pharmaceutical sector pharmaceutical industry has all the processes of nature and Drug Licenses, Article and distribution of the industry have a direct impact on people\\'s health and lives are strictly managed and controlled, especially in the domestic pharmaceutical market is the population aging etc. and the expansion of the social security system and maintain a high growth rate. The pharmaceutical industry is relatively inelastic to the economic cycle than in other industries. For the case of generic medicines rather cyclical and seasonal factors affected side, or prescription drugs to have a more sensitive nature than factors such as fluctuations are political factors. Recently, the government will continue to enforce the drug can regulate policies such as low purchase incentives, re-bait the ssangbeol, a group listed pharmaceutical bulk drug price cuts. We are committed to expanding exports by expanding exports to Samyang Bio farm surgical sutures for the US and European developed markets, and promote the next generation of cancer drugs exports of \\'The neksol -PM week. ② Samyang Samyang Entech Entech is the machine business and the business environment is the main business.
